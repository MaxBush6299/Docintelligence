## Executive Summary

Public Law 119-21 is a sweeping reconciliation measure that restructures major federal programs across agriculture, nutrition, health care, energy, national security, immigration, tax policy, education, spectrum management, and space. It couples long‑term authorizations and appropriations with extensive policy changes, rescissions, and compliance guardrails, and it phases many reforms in over the 2025–2034 period.

Agricultural policy is modernized with higher, CPI‑adjusted payment limits and revised attribution rules, an expanded pathway for base acres allocations capped at 30 million acres beginning with the 2026 crop year, and extended producer elections for Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage through 2031. Reference prices rise and escalate modestly after 2030, while marketing assistance loans, loan deficiency payments, and recourse loans are extended with updated crop‑specific loan rates. The law refines cotton storage and repayment rules, authorizes extra‑long staple cotton flexibility to avoid forfeitures, and strengthens textile support. Sugar policy is reset by raising loan rates, establishing storage rates, refining quota reallocation processes, and directing studies on refined sugar import terms. Crop insurance is expanded through higher coverage limits, enhanced premium support—especially for beginning farmers and specialty crops—new administrative reimbursements, and pilots for poultry weather‑driven utility costs. Conservation programs receive increased, multi‑year funding and CCC support; horticulture and specialty crop grants are boosted; research funding flows to the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, 1890 scholarships, and specialty initiatives; and trade promotion is augmented from CCC funds. Dairy Margin Coverage thresholds rise with updated production history rules, and livestock disaster aid is broadened to unborn animals, predation, adverse weather, farm‑raised fish, and honeybee mortality.

Nutrition reforms anchor the Thrifty Food Plan to USDA’s 2021 baseline with CPI updates and guardrails against cost growth, recalibrate household allotment ratios, and refine utility and shelter deduction rules. SNAP administration is restructured: federal cost‑sharing for state expenses declines over time; state error rates drive future federal matching shares; quality control incentives are added; and limited, report‑heavy exemptions are permitted but sunset. Work requirement exceptions are clarified, internet service fees are excluded from shelter deductions, and alien eligibility is narrowed to specified lawful statuses with new income/resource counting rules. The law also sets cost‑sharing parameters for certain Medicaid expansion adults, creates a Rural Health Transformation Program with substantial state allotments and targeted uses, and exempts parent matching for those funds.

Medicaid and Medicare undergo broad integrity and eligibility changes. State‑directed payment rates are capped relative to Medicare, provider taxes face phased caps and clarified redistributive tests, and section 1115 demonstrations must be certified budget neutral. States must build a cross‑state enrollment system, verify addresses and disenroll nonresidents, and conduct quarterly checks against the Death Master File for members and providers. Retroactive eligibility windows shrink, alien eligibility is tightened, and community engagement requirements are established for expansion adults with structured exemptions, notices, verification, and fair hearing protections. States gain new HCBS waiver flexibilities with cost‑neutrality attestations and data reporting, and CMS staffing rules for long‑term care facilities are placed under a moratorium. Medicare eligibility is limited to specified citizenship or lawful statuses, a 2026 fee schedule add‑on is provided, and drug price negotiation clarifies the orphan drug exclusion timeline.

Energy and natural resources policy turns sharply toward domestic supply and development. The law rescinds and repeals significant climate and environmental program balances, directs robust offshore and onshore oil and gas leasing schedules in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska’s Cook Inlet, the NPR‑A, and BLM lands, and codifies royalty and term parameters. Federal coal leasing accelerates with capped royalty rates and credits for overpaid advances, and long‑term timber sale targets are mandated on National Forest System and BLM lands. Renewable energy right‑of‑way rents and capacity fees are standardized with revenue sharing for states and counties. A parallel set of clean energy credit reforms restricts eligibility where facilities or components involve “prohibited foreign entities,” imposes rising domestic content thresholds, requires supplier certifications and safe harbor tables, establishes penalties and recapture for misstatements or effective control, phases out certain credits and component categories, and extends the clean fuel production credit with revised emissions accounting and feedstock rules.

The law extends FCC spectrum auction authority to 2034, directs identification and licensing of substantial mid‑band spectrum for high‑power flexible use while excluding certain bands, sets aggressive auction milestones, and funds spectrum valuation studies. Space and aviation receive large investments: NASA is funded for Artemis, Mars communications and Gateway, and center infrastructure; commercial space launch and reentry licensing is supported by new user fees dedicated to the FAA Office; and spaceports are explicitly eligible for tax‑exempt facility bonds. FAA is appropriated for major air traffic control system modernization, consolidation, and safety upgrades, with recurrent reporting requirements.

Tax policy delivers permanent individual rate relief and the enlarged standard deduction, raises and indexes the child tax credit with stricter SSN requirements, modifies the SALT cap and itemized deduction limits, and updates casualty loss and mortgage interest rules. The qualified business income deduction thresholds rise with a minimum floor; AMT parameters are recalibrated; and the estate and gift exclusion increases. Charitable giving is reworked with floors, ceilings, and carryforward ordering; the Low‑Income Housing Tax Credit state ceilings and bond rules are enhanced permanently; the New Markets Tax Credit is made permanent; and Opportunity Zones are overhauled—adding rural zones, new reporting by funds and Treasury, data privacy aggregation, revised holding‑period and basis rules, and penalties for reporting failures. The law creates deductions for reported cash tips and qualified overtime (with reporting and temporary windows), adds a temporary personal‑use vehicle loan interest deduction, and codifies direct primary care fee treatment for HSAs while permanently allowing HDHPs to cover telehealth. A new “Trump account” regime is established as IRAs for minors with employer and general contribution exclusions, trustee standards, investment limits, reporting, rollovers to ABLE accounts, and a child‑focused contribution pilot. Education benefits expand: employer student loan payments are permanently excluded and indexed, 529s cover more expenses with higher limits, and scholarship contributions to state‑listed organizations earn a capped credit while scholarships are excluded from income.

Business tax reforms lock in full expensing with 100 percent bonus depreciation for qualified property, add a special allowance for designated production property, and permit immediate deductions for domestic R&E under a new section 174A (with optional amortization and coordinated credit rules). Interest limitation rules are adjusted and coordinated with capitalization, section 179 expensing limits rise, and the paid family and medical leave credit is refined for insurance‑based coverage, aggregation, and employee eligibility. Advanced manufacturing credits increase, exempt facility bond rules explicitly include spaceports, and meals at specified fishing operations are fully deductible. International tax revisions retarget FDII as FDDEI, reframe GILTI to “net CFC tested income” while eliminating the deemed routine return, raise deemed paid FTC percentages and the section 78 gross‑up, restore the bar on downward attribution, make CFC look‑through permanent, tighten BEAT, and recalibrate interest and tested income definitions, with updated pro rata share timing and coordination rules.

National defense, maritime, and homeland security receive substantial multi‑year appropriations to expand munitions, shipbuilding, missile defense, nuclear systems, space assets, logistics, and Indo‑Pacific posture, and to recapitalize depots and shipyards. The Coast Guard mission readiness package funds cutters, icebreakers, aircraft, and shore facilities, while DHS and DOJ lines finance border infrastructure, surveillance, CBP personnel and vehicles, ICE detention (including family detention standards), immigration court staffing, training centers, critical minerals stockpile, and multiple enforcement initiatives. A parallel immigration finance title imposes or increases numerous fees—covering asylum, TPS, parole, motions and appeals, adjustment and cancellation filings, EVUS, I‑94, inadmissible apprehensions, and more—indexes them to inflation, restricts waivers, and directs deposits among Treasury, USCIS, ICE, and EOIR. ORR sponsor vetting is tightened with biometric checks and household scrutiny, and states are funded for security at major events and to reinforce border operations under federal constraints.

Higher education and student loan policy is comprehensively reset. Graduate PLUS loans end and unsubsidized Stafford limits for graduate and professional students rise with new annual and lifetime caps, proportional reductions for part‑time enrollment, and institution‑set program caps. Repayment shifts to a new Repayment Assistance Plan with income‑linked monthly amounts, automatic IRS recertification, interest relief for on‑time payments, rehabilitation expansions, and cancellation after qualifying payment counts; legacy income‑contingent options sunset and deferment/forbearance are tightened. Pell Grants add a Workforce Pell pathway for short, Governor‑validated programs meeting completion, placement, and value‑added earnings tests; Pell eligibility is denied when non‑federal aid meets cost of attendance; and institutions face accountability tied to low earnings outcomes. Borrower defense and closed school discharge rules are delayed for pre‑2035 loans, and asset protections are expanded for family farms, small businesses, and fishing enterprises.

Opportunity zones and rural opportunity zones gain rigorous reporting by funds and Treasury with penalties, updated designation schedules, new rural‑area rules, and revised substantial improvement thresholds, while Treasury must publish multi‑year socioeconomic comparisons. Public administration measures include FEHB eligibility verification and audits, PRAC extension and funding, OMB efficiency appropriations, debt limit increase, and cultural, spectrum, and space infrastructure allocations. Radiation Exposure Compensation Act coverage is broadened with longer qualifying periods, expanded geographies, standardized awards, uranium‑worker categories, and new Manhattan Project waste claims. Across the act, numerous compliance and enforcement provisions mandate data reporting, electronic filing, program integrity audits, and anti‑circumvention rules to ensure policy goals are met and federal funds are properly safeguarded.

#### Page 10

The text lists sections appropriating funds to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, the Department of Justice, a reimbursement fund for immigration-related deficits, the Bureau of Prisons, the United States Secret Service, judiciary offices, and addresses radiation exposure compensation. It then begins Title I on nutrition by amending the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to define the Thrifty Food Plan per USDA’s 2021 report with limits on changes and cost adjustments, and establishes household allotment ratios from 30% for one person to 180% for eight persons.

#### Page 11

For households of 9 or more there is an additional 22 percent per person, capped so the additional percentage does not exceed 200 percent; the Secretary must adjust the thrifty food plan for Hawaii and urban and rural Alaska and separately for Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands (not exceeding costs in the 50 States and D.C.), update it annually for CPI-U starting October 1, 2025, and may re-evaluate its market baskets no earlier than October 1, 2027, without increasing overall cost. The law makes conforming cross-reference changes from section 3(u)(4) to 3(u)(3) and revises SNAP able-bodied adult work requirement exceptions to include individuals under 18 or over 65, those medically unfit, caregivers of a dependent child under 14, those otherwise exempt under subsection (d)(2), pregnant women, and Indians or Urban Indians.

#### Page 12

Adds "a California Indian described in section 809(a) of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act" and amends the Food and Nutrition Act to define "noncontiguous State" (excluding Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and require that an area be in a noncontiguous State with unemployment at least 1.5 times the national rate. It establishes an exemption process enabling the Secretary to waive paragraph (2) requirements for individuals in noncontiguous States upon a State agency’s request and a good-faith effort determination, considering actions toward compliance, significant barriers such as funding or system development, and a detailed plan and timeline with milestones.

#### Page 13

Exemptions for State agencies are limited to expiring by December 31, 2028, may be terminated early by the Secretary for reporting noncompliance or lack of good-faith progress, and require quarterly milestone reports and plans to mitigate identified risks and barriers. The page amends the Food and Nutrition Act to differentiate utility allowances and third-party energy assistance for households with or without elderly or disabled members, prohibits internet connection service fees from the excess shelter deduction, and restructures matching funds provisions to establish the program and add a State quality control incentive.

#### Page 14

The page defines “payment error rate” by reference to section 16(c)(2) and, beginning in fiscal year 2028, sets federal/state cost shares for a State’s allotment based on its payment error rate: federal 100% if <6%, 95% if ≥6% and <8%, 90% if ≥8% and <10%, and 85% if ≥10%. For FY 2028 a State may use its FY 2025 or 2026 error rate; for FY 2029 and thereafter the Secretary uses the rate from the third preceding fiscal year; implementation is delayed to FY 2029 or 2030 if the FY 2025 or 2026 rate multiplied by 1.5 is at least 20%; the Secretary may not pay more than the applicable federal share; and Section 13(a)(1) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 is amended.

#### Page 15

The law makes technical and programmatic amendments to the Food and Nutrition Act, inserting a reference to payment or disposition of a State share under section 4(a)(2), changing federal administrative cost sharing to 50% through FY2026 and 25% thereafter, and limiting the National Education and Obesity Prevention grant authority to FY2016–2025. It rewrites SNAP alien eligibility to require U.S. residency and specified lawful statuses (citizen, LPR, Cuban/Haitian entrant, or COFA resident), counts the income and resources of ineligible household members with an optional pro rata exclusion, and rescinds unobligated forestry funds appropriated by Public Law 117-169, section 23001(a)(3) and (4).

#### Page 16

The law amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to increase the effective reference price factor to 88% beginning with the 2025 crop year and to set explicit reference prices for covered commodities starting in 2025. Beginning in 2031 those reference prices increase by 0.5% annually but are capped at 113% of the listed amounts, and the base acres provision is amended to change a date from 2023 to 2031 and add a new subsection on additional base acres.

#### Page 17

The Secretary must, as soon as practicable after enactment and notwithstanding subsection (a), notify farm owners and allocate no more than an additional 30,000,000 base acres, allow owners to decline within 90 days of notice, and include in the notice information on the allocation, eligibility, and an appeals process for ineligibility determinations. Effective beginning with the 2026 crop year, a farm is eligible for an allocation if the subparagraph (B) 5-year average sum for 2019–2023—covering acres planted to covered commodities plus prevented planting of covered commodities, and the lesser of 15 percent of total farm acres or the 5-year average (including prevented planting) of eligible noncovered commodities—exceeds the amount described in subparagraph (C).

#### Page 18

For each farm, the total number of base acres for covered commodities is that in effect on September 30, 2024 (excluding unassigned crop base); farms for which the amount under paragraph (3)(B)(i) is zero are ineligible, “acreage planted on the farm to eligible noncovered commodities” means acreage planted to commodities other than covered commodities, trees, bushes, vines, grass, or pasture (including idle or fallow), as determined by the Secretary, and the number of base acres allocated equals the amount in paragraph (3)(B) minus the amount in paragraph (3)(C) and includes unassigned crop base. The Secretary shall allocate the resulting base acres among covered commodities planted on the farm during the 2019 through 2023 crop years in proportion to each commodity’s ratio of its 5-year average of planted (for harvest, grazing, haying, silage, or similar purposes) plus prevented planting acreage due to drought, flood, or other natural disasters or conditions beyond producers’ control to the farm’s 5-year average under paragraph (3)(B)(i), shall not exclude any crop year in which a covered commodity was not planted, and shall address multiple plantings or prevented plantings.

#### Page 19

Allocation of additional base acres among covered commodities may not exceed a farm’s total acres, is subject to a nationwide pro-rata reduction to cap allocations at 30,000,000 acres, establishes PLC payment yields for such base acres beginning in 2026 using existing farm yields or, if unavailable, county averages or section 1113(c), and requires use of prior owners’ planting histories for determining eligibility and allocations on newly owned farms. The producer election provisions in 7 U.S.C. 9015 are extended through 2031 and revised to include the option to make elections for the 2026 crop year in addition to prior elections for 2019.

#### Page 20

Coverage elected for each covered commodity in 2025 must continue for 2027–2031, and for the 2025 crop year the Secretary must provide the higher of Price Loss Coverage or Agriculture Risk Coverage county payments per commodity, while the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to allow the Supplemental Coverage Option on acres without the prior ARC-related restriction. The law extends PLC and ARC authorities to 2031, sets ARC coverage at 90 percent of benchmark revenue for 2025–2031, corrects a cross-reference, and updates historical reference years from 2012–2016 to 2017–2021.

#### Page 21

Benchmark revenue percentages are set at 10 percent for crop years 2014–2024 and 12 percent for 2025–2031, with several subsections updating the end date from 2023 to 2031. Section 10306 defines “qualified pass-through entity” to include partnerships, S corporations, certain LLCs, and joint ventures/general partnerships, and replaces prior references throughout multiple provisions, affecting payment attribution, active engagement in farming, and joint and several liability, with an AGI exclusion provision also amended.

#### Page 22

Payment limitations under Section 1001 are increased from $125,000 to $155,000 for subsections (b) and (c), made subject to annual CPI-based inflation adjustments beginning with the 2025 crop year, and references to “general partnership” or “joint venture” are struck. Section 1001D(b) is amended to add an exception for certain payments whereby the AGI cap does not apply if at least 75% of a person’s or entity’s average gross income comes from defined farming, ranching, or silviculture activities, including agri-tourism, direct-to-consumer sales, and sale of owned agricultural equipment, with covered payments including specified programs and those received on or after October 1, 2024.

#### Page 23

Extends the availability of nonrecourse marketing assistance loans under the Agricultural Act of 2014 through 2031, updates Section 1202(b) references to 2025, redesignates subsections, and adds a new subsection (c) establishing loan rates for the 2026–2031 crop years. Subsection (c) sets specific per‑unit rates for many commodities, including wheat ($3.72/bushel), corn and grain sorghum ($2.42/bushel), barley ($2.75/bushel), oats ($2.20/bushel), upland cotton ($0.55/lb), extra long staple cotton ($1.00/lb), long and medium grain rice ($7.70/cwt), soybeans ($6.82/bushel), listed oilseeds ($11.10/cwt), dry peas ($6.87/cwt), lentils ($14.30/cwt), small and large chickpeas ($11.00/$15.40/cwt), graded/nongraded wool ($1.60/$0.55/lb), mohair ($5.00/lb), honey ($1.50/lb), and peanuts ($390/ton), with a conforming cross-reference update.

#### Page 24

The page amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 by increasing a specified rate from $0.25 to $0.30 and revising cotton storage payments—extending coverage through the 2025 crop year and, for 2026–2031, requiring payments for upland and extra long staple cotton at the lesser of the submitted storage charge or $4.90 in California/Arizona and $3.00 in other States. It extends loan deficiency payments and payments in lieu through 2031, special competitive provisions for extra long staple cotton to 2032, and the availability of recourse loans to 2031, and revises marketing loan repayment provisions by restructuring subsection (b) and providing that for long and medium grain rice the repayment may use the prevailing world market price as determined by the Secretary.

#### Page 25

The law amends marketing assistance loan repayment to permit repayment at the lesser of the loan rate or the Secretary-determined prevailing world market price and, for upland cotton, establishes a refund equal to any difference between the repayment rate and the lowest prevailing world market price during the 30 days following repayment. It updates price determination rules to include extra long staple cotton, directs that upland cotton formulas use the average of the three lowest-priced Middling (M) 13/32-inch growths when available, extends the relevant date from 2024 to 2032, and requires the extra long staple cotton world price to be adjusted for U.S. quality, location, and average marketing and transportation costs.

#### Page 26

The law authorizes the Secretary to further adjust extra-long staple cotton parameters from enactment through July 31, 2032 to minimize loan forfeitures and Federal stock accumulation, ensure competitive marketing, and manage transitions between current- and forward-crop price quotations, allowing reliance on forward quotes before July 31 only if current quotes are insufficient and the forward quote is the lowest available. It increases Economic Adjustment Assistance for Textile Mills from 3 cents per pound through July 31, 2025 to 5 cents beginning August 1, 2025, updates the sugar program by setting the raw cane sugar loan rate at 24.00 cents per pound for the 2025–2031 crop years with a corresponding rate equal to 136.55 percent of that amount and extending provisions to 2031, and directs the Commodity Credit Corporation to establish storage rates starting with the 2025 crop year.

#### Page 27

Sets minimum monthly storage rates for forfeited sugar—34 cents per hundredweight for refined sugar and 27 cents for raw cane—and revises a subsection heading to “PRIOR” while limiting a provision “through 2024.” Modernizes beet sugar allotments by extending sugar estimates to 2031, prioritizing processors with available sugar when allocations are adjusted upward, imposing January WASDE-based determinations with a 30-day initial reassignment deadline, and initiating a new reallocation process for tariff-rate quota shortfalls.

#### Page 28

The Secretary must identify countries unlikely to fulfill their raw cane sugar tariff-rate quota allocations and reallocate forecasted shortfalls as soon as practicable, with any additional shortfalls reallocated by March 1 of the quota year; these requirements cease if the 2014 suspension agreement on Mexican sugar is terminated and no countervailing duty order on Mexican sugar is in effect. The subsection defines the domestic sugar industry (sugar beet and cane producers and processors and refiners of raw cane sugar) and, within 180 days of enactment, requires a study on whether to add terms for refined sugar imports, evaluating a 99.8-degree polarization definition, color/reflectance standards, packaging and transportation specifications, evidence that imports will not undergo further refining in the United States, terms to avoid unlawful sugar imports, other possible requirements, and the impacts of such changes on the domestic industry.

#### Page 29

It requires the Secretary to study and report within a year on refined sugar import terms in consultation with industry, allows subsequent regulations adding necessary and appropriate conditions only if they do not adversely affect the domestic sugar industry and comply with existing statutes and approved trade agreements, clarifies tariff-rate quota adjustment authority, and extends the period of effectiveness to 2031. It also updates dairy policy by revising Dairy Margin Coverage to modify the production history definition and, except as provided in subsection (b), set a dairy operation’s production history to its highest annual milk marketings in 2021, 2022, or 2023.

#### Page 30

New dairy operations under a year old must choose to determine production history by extrapolating actual milk marketings to an annual amount or by estimating marketings based on herd size relative to the national rolling herd average. The law raises Dairy Margin Coverage thresholds from 5,000,000 to 6,000,000, updates premium discount dates to 2026–2031 and extends the program through 2031, and authorizes $50,000,000 in further funding with specified allocations including at least $5,000,000 for subsection (b)(3)–(4), $3,000,000 each for (3)(A) and (3)(B), and $9,000,000 designated for additional uses.

#### Page 31

Allocates funding for mandatory surveys of dairy production costs and product yields from manufacturers reporting under 7 U.S.C. 1637b, with biennial publication of results, and provides $1,000,000 for a study under 7 U.S.C. 1359kk. Amends Livestock Indemnity Payments to pay 100% of market value for predation losses and 75% for adverse weather or disease, permits use of documented regional price premiums in valuing livestock, defines the applicable date as the day before death or the harmful event, and authorizes additional payments for unborn livestock losses incurred on or after January 1, 2024 at rates set by the Secretary.

#### Page 32

Establishes payment rules for unborn livestock death losses, capping rates at up to 85 percent of the lowest weight class rate and multiplying by species-specific factors (1, 2, 12, or the average number of birthed animals per gestation), with such losses defined as deaths of gestating livestock. It also revises the Livestock Forage Disaster Program to allow up to 2 monthly payments and eligibility for assistance after 4 consecutive weeks during the normal grazing period, and authorizes payments to eligible producers of farm-raised fish to reduce losses due to piscivorous birds, with payment rates set by the Secretary considering deterrence costs.

#### Page 33

Payments for farm-raised fish losses due to bird depredation are based on lost fish, revenue, and disease costs, with a minimum rate of $600 per acre and a total payment equal to the rate multiplied by 85 percent of the producer’s acres in production, and honeybee colony assistance uses a 15 percent normal mortality rate. The Tree Assistance Program replaces specified 15 percent damage/mortality thresholds with references to normal damage or mortality and raises a figure from 50 to 65, while crop insurance provisions extend the beginning farmer and rancher definition from 5 to 10 years, remove a conforming subparagraph, and add extra premium assistance above existing levels for beginning farmers and ranchers.

#### Page 34

The law adjusts beginning farmer or rancher premium subsidy percentage points by reinsurance year (5 percentage points for the first two years, 3 in the third, and 1 in the fourth), increases allowable crop insurance coverage levels to up to 85% for individual coverage, 90% for aggregated individual coverage across commodities, and 95% for area coverage, revises thresholds in section 508(c)(4)(C) (14 to 10 and 86 to 90), and raises the premium subsidy in section 508(e)(2)(H)(i) from 65 to 80. Beginning with the 2026 reinsurance year, approved insurance providers will receive an additional administrative and operating expense subsidy equal to 6 percent of the net book premium for eligible contracts to cover loss adjustment procedures.

#### Page 35

It defines an "eligible contract" as a crop insurance contract in an eligible State excluding catastrophic policies, area-based plans, and policies without loss adjustment expenses, and an "eligible State" as one where the loss ratio for eligible contracts exceeds 120 percent of total net book premium in an insurance year. Beginning with the 2026 reinsurance year, it requires minimum administrative and operating expense reimbursements for specialty crop contracts at the greater of 17 percent of premium or the Standard Reinsurance Agreement rate, bars reductions for other contracts, clarifies such adjustments are not a renegotiation, and mandates inflation-based increases to total administrative and operating expense reimbursements.

#### Page 36

It caps any 2026 reinsurance year increase to the prior year’s CPI change, applies such increases to all contracts that were increased in 2011–2015 without treating them as renegotiations, and raises premium support percentages under 7 U.S.C. 1508(e)(2) to 69, 64, 60, 51, and 41 percent. It also increases program compliance and integrity funding to $6,000,000 annually from FY2026 under section 515(l)(2) and to $10,000,000 from FY2026 under section 516(b)(2)(C)(i), and establishes a poultry insurance pilot program allowing contract broiler and layer growers to elect index-based insurance.

#### Page 37

The law directs the Corporation to establish a pilot insurance program for poultry producers to cover weather-related increases in utility costs, requiring stakeholder engagement, implementation across enough counties in top poultry-producing states, and Board approval of a resulting policy under section 508(h) within two years. It also updates conservation program funding in the Food Security Act for fiscal years 2026–2031 ($625m–$700m under paragraph (2), $2.655b–$3.255b under paragraph (3)(A), and $1.3b–$1.375b under paragraph (3)(B)) and revises the Regional Conservation Partnership Program to use Commodity Credit Corporation funds to the maximum extent practicable.

#### Page 38

Adds a new 51 U.S.C. §20306 for special appropriations to Mars, Artemis, and Moon to Mars programs; sets Corporate Average Fuel Economy civil penalties in 49 U.S.C. §32912 to $0.00 effective upon enactment and adjusts Metropolitan Washington Airports lease payments to $3,000,000 (1987 dollars) through 2026 and $15,000,000 (2027 dollars) thereafter with renegotiation every 10 years. Rescinds unobligated NOAA balances from Public Law 117-169 §§40001–40004 and reduces annual transfers to the Travel Promotion Fund from $100,000,000 to $20,000,000.

#### Page 67

Sections 40010 and 40011 rescind any unobligated balances made available under section 40007(a) of Public Law 117-169 for alternative fuel and low-emission aviation technology, and permanently rescind $850,000,000 in unobligated balances from the CHIPS Act Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund. Section 50101 repeals certain Inflation Reduction Act provisions on onshore oil and gas royalty rates and noncompetitive leasing, restores prior law, directs the Secretary of the Interior to immediately resume quarterly onshore lease sales with timely completion of Mineral Leasing Act and NEPA processes, and defines "eligible lands" as all lands subject to leasing not excluded by statute and "available" lands as those designated open under a land use plan.

#### Page 68

The Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to hold at least four oil and gas lease sales each fiscal year in Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, and Alaska, offering at least 50 percent of nominated parcels available under applicable resource management plans, not limiting offerings to a single BLM field office unless all nominations are there, and conducting a same-year replacement sale if a sale is canceled, delayed, deferred, or if 25 percent or more of acreage offered receives no bid. It further amends Section 17 of the Mineral Leasing Act to require that parcels known or believed to contain oil or gas be made available for leasing within 18 months of an expression of interest if they are open to leasing under the applicable approved resource management plan.

#### Page 69

Leases issued under this section must adhere to the approved resource management plan without extra stipulations, plan amendments shall not delay leasing, and any approved permit to drill is valid for a single, non-renewable four-year period. The Secretary must approve applications to commingle production from multiple sources before royalty measurement if specified measurement devices or methods achieve ±2% uncertainty or use approved periodic testing (with discretion to allow higher uncertainty when justified), treating multi-lease production from a single wellbore as a single source, and authorizes additional lease sales in the Gulf of America Region notwithstanding the 2024–2029 National OCS program and any successor that does not meet this section’s requirements.

#### Page 70

The Secretary of the Interior must conduct at least 30 region-wide oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf region identified in Lease Sale 254, with at least one by December 15, 2025, two per year from 2026 through 2039 (one by March 15 and one by August 15), and one by March 15, 2040. The Secretary must also hold at least six offshore lease sales in Alaska’s Cook Inlet Planning Area (one by March 15 in each of 2026–2028 and 2030–2032), and for Gulf of America sales shall use the same lease form, terms, economic conditions, and stipulations 4–9 as Lease Sale 254 while permitting updates to stipulations 1–3 and 10.

#### Page 71

Establishes offshore lease terms including a royalty rate between 12.5 percent and 16 2/3 percent and a 10-year primary term for leases issued in water depths of 800 meters or deeper, and for Alaska-region sales requires using the Lease Sale 244 terms with revenues from fiscal year 2034 split 70 percent to Alaska and 30 percent to the Treasury. It mandates offering at least 80,000,000 acres per Gulf of America sale and 1,000,000 acres per Alaska sale (or all unleased available acreage if less), directs approval of commingling in a single OCS wellbore in the Gulf unless conclusively unsafe or reducing recovery, and repeals section 50261 of Public Law 117-169 to restore prior law while amending OCSLA section 8(a)(1) on the royalty rate.

#### Page 72

The text amends several subparagraphs to replace “per centum” with “percent” and set applicable rates at not less than 12.5 percent and not more than 16 2/3 percent, and revises the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act limits by changing subparagraph (C) to 2024 and adding caps of $650,000,000 for each fiscal year 2025–2034 and $500,000,000 for each fiscal year 2035–2055. It repeals Section 50263 of Public Law 117-169 concerning royalties on extracted methane and requires the Secretary of the Interior to hold at least four area-wide lease sales for the Alaska Coastal Plain within 10 years under the 2020 BLM Record of Decision terms, with further direction on sale acreages and scheduling.

#### Page 73

The Secretary must offer lease sales of at least 400,000 acres area-wide each, prioritizing areas with the highest hydrocarbon potential, with four sales scheduled no later than 1, 3, 5, and 7 years after enactment, and apply existing rights-of-way and surface development provisions from Public Law 115-97 to those leases. Adjusted bonus, rental, and royalty receipts from Coastal Plain oil and gas operations are allocated 50% to Alaska for FY2025–2033 and 70% from FY2034 onward with the remainder to the Treasury, and the NPR-A section defines the June 2020 final EIS (including the Oct. 6, 2020 errata and excluding the Sept. 20, 2022 errata), the Dec. 2020 record of decision, the Program under 42 U.S.C. 6506a, and the Secretary as the Secretary of the Interior.

#### Page 74

Effective upon enactment, the Secretary must expeditiously restore NPR-A oil and gas leasing and conduct at least five lease sales within 10 years, each offering no fewer than 4,000,000 acres, with the first sale within one year and additional sales at least every two years, using the same lease form, terms, economic conditions, and stipulations as in the NPR-A final environmental impact statement and record of decision. Beginning in fiscal year 2034, 70% of specified NPR-A lease receipts go to the State of Alaska and 30% to the U.S. Treasury, and Subtitle B (Mining) commences by defining a “coal lease” as a BLM lease executed on Form 3400-012 (or successor).

#### Page 75

The page defines “qualified application” for coal leases and requires the Secretary of the Interior, within 90 days of enactment, to publish any required environmental reviews, set fair market value, hold a lease sale, identify the highest bidder, and take necessary steps to grant the lease, while permitting needed approvals for previously issued leases and issuance to the qualified applicant if they win. It amends the Mineral Leasing Act to retain a 12.5 percent royalty but cap it at not more than 7 percent through September 30, 2034, applies this to all non-terminated leases issued before, on, or after enactment, and directs credits to lessees for advance royalties previously paid above what the new rate would require.

#### Page 76

The page requires the Secretary of the Interior, within 90 days of enactment, to make available for lease at least 4,000,000 additional acres of known recoverable coal resources on federal lands in the contiguous 48 states and Alaska, excluding specified protected areas such as National Monuments, Wilderness, Parks, Refuges, and similar units. It also authorizes mining of certain federal coal reserves adjacent to state or private reserves under previously approved mining plans, directs prompt authorization without substantial modification while preserving NEPA review, and begins a lands subtitle defining terms for Forest Service timber sales and long-term contracting, including “forest plan” and “National Forest System.”

#### Page 77

The page defines the National Forest System as administered by the Secretary of Agriculture (through the Chief of the Forest Service) and excluding any forest reserve not created from the public domain, mandates that from fiscal years 2026 through 2034 timber sales on National Forest System lands increase by at least 250,000,000 board-feet annually over the prior year subject to limits in the applicable forest plan, and requires at least 40 long-term (minimum 20-year) timber sale contracts during fiscal years 2025 through 2034 with proceeds deposited in the Treasury. For Bureau of Land Management public lands, it defines “public lands,” “resource management plan,” and the Secretary (the Secretary of the Interior acting through the BLM Director) and requires annual timber sales to increase by at least 20,000,000 board-feet over the previous year for fiscal years 2026 through 2034.

#### Page 78

For FY2025–2034, the Secretary must enter at least five long-term (minimum 20-year, extendable) contracts under the Materials Act for disposal of vegetative materials on public lands, deposit any receipts into the Treasury’s general fund, and ensure specified timber sales comply with the resource management plan in effect at enactment. It defines key terms for renewable energy fees on federal land, including a 3% Annual Adjustment Factor, Encumbrance Factors (100% for solar and not less than 10% for wind as set by the Secretary), the scope of National Forest System lands, the Per-Acre Rate based on five-year state pastureland rent averages, “project” per 43 CFR 2801.9(a)(4), and “public land” encompassing FLPMA public lands and National Forest System lands.

#### Page 79

The page defines key terms (renewable energy project, right-of-way, Secretary) and directs the Secretary to collect an annual acreage rent from right-of-way holders for wind and solar projects by January 1, calculated using a formula based on a per-acre rate, an encumbrance factor, an annual adjustment factor, and the year of the right-of-way term, and payable until energy generation begins. It further requires an annual capacity fee equal to the greater of the acreage rent or 3.9 percent of gross electricity sale proceeds, and allows wind project right-of-way holders to apply for a 10 percent multiple-use reduction to that capacity fee.

#### Page 80

The Secretary may approve an application to apply a multiple-use reduction factor to a wind energy right-of-way capacity fee only if at least 25 percent of the right-of-way area is authorized for year-round non-wind uses; if approval comes after capacity fees have begun, the reduction applies starting the next year and no refunds are allowed for prior payments. The Secretary may charge a late fee if acreage rent or capacity fees are more than 15 days overdue and may terminate the right-of-way if payment is more than 90 days overdue, and the renewable energy revenue sharing section defines county (including similar local governments), covered land (public land administered by the Secretary not excluded from solar or wind development under a land use plan or other Federal law), and National Forest System (as defined in 16 U.S.C. 1609(a) and excluding forest reserves not created from the public domain).

#### Page 81

It defines “renewable energy project” as wind or solar systems on covered land (public lands and National Forest System land), clarifies the responsible Secretary (Interior or Agriculture), and, beginning January 1, 2026, requires revenues from such projects to be deposited in the Treasury’s general fund and allocated 25% to the State and 25% to affected counties based on the share of county land from which the revenue is derived. Amounts paid to States and counties must be used in accordance with Mineral Leasing Act section 35, are in addition to PILT, are disbursed in the following fiscal year, and the Act rescinds unobligated balances of funds provided by sections 50221–50223 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

#### Page 82

$150,000,000 is appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior (through the National Park Service) for events, celebrations, and activities commemorating the United States’ 250th anniversary, to remain available through fiscal year 2028. The law appropriates to the Department of Energy $218,000,000 for maintenance and repairs of Strategic Petroleum Reserve facilities and $171,000,000 to purchase petroleum for the Reserve (available until September 30, 2029), repeals the SPR drawdown and sale mandate, rescinds unobligated balances from Section 50142 and several other named sections of the Inflation Reduction Act, and amends Section 1706 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

#### Page 83

The law revises energy program authorities to emphasize increasing capacity and supporting forecastable electric supply for grid reliability, streamlines and redesignates subsections, updates language to cover activities across the energy and critical minerals supply chain, appropriates $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2025 available through September 30, 2028 with up to 3 percent for administrative costs, and extends Inflation Reduction Act commitment authority from 2026 to 2028. It also defines the American science cloud and artificial intelligence and directs the Department of Energy to mobilize National Laboratories to partner with industry to curate, structure, clean, and preprocess DOE scientific data for use in AI and machine learning models.

#### Page 84

Initiatives are funded to use curated datasets to seed self-improving AI models for science and engineering, enabling rapid advances in next-generation microelectronics beyond Moore’s law with lower energy use and accelerating discovery of new energy technologies via the American science cloud, with $150,000,000 appropriated through September 30, 2026. Additionally, $1,000,000,000 is appropriated through September 30, 2034 to expand capacity of existing Bureau of Reclamation conveyance and surface water storage facilities (with related contracts not treated as new or amended and no reimbursement or cost-sharing), unobligated balances for Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicles funding are rescinded, and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is repealed with its unobligated balances rescinded.

#### Page 85

Rescinds the unobligated balances of funds made available for multiple environmental and air quality initiatives, including diesel emissions reductions, efforts to address air pollution (including at schools), the Low Emissions Electricity Program, and activities under Clean Air Act section 211(o). It further rescinds unobligated balances for implementation of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, enforcement technology and public information, greenhouse gas corporate reporting, environmental product declaration assistance, and methane emissions and waste reduction incentive programs for petroleum and natural gas systems under Clean Air Act section 136.

#### Page 86

Section 136(g) of the Clean Air Act is amended to extend the period from calendar year 2024 to calendar year 2034. Additionally, the unobligated balances of funds are rescinded for greenhouse gas air pollution plans and implementation grants, EPA efficient, accurate, and timely reviews, low-embodied carbon labeling for construction materials, Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, ESA recovery plans, environmental and climate data collection, the Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant Program, Federal Building Assistance, Low-Carbon Materials for Federal Buildings, and GSA Emerging and Sustainable Technologies.

#### Page 87

Unobligated balances for environmental review implementation (23 U.S.C. 178) and low-carbon transportation materials grants (23 U.S.C. 179) are rescinded, and $256,657,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2025 through September 30, 2029 for capital repair, restoration, maintenance backlog, and security structures at the John F. Kennedy Center, with up to 3 percent available for administrative costs. NEPA is amended to create a project sponsor opt-in fee process where sponsors submit project details and intentions to the Council on Environmental Quality, which must set the fee within 15 days, and environmental assessments paid for by such fees must be completed within 180 days of payment while environmental impact statements must be completed within 1 year of the notice of intent.

#### Page 88

Fees for environmental assessments and environmental impact statements are set at 125 percent of anticipated preparation costs, including 125 percent of anticipated supervision and, as applicable, preparation costs when a project sponsor prepares them under section 107(f). The page then amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide permanent tax relief by removing sunset dates on reduced rates and the increased standard deduction, adjusting inflation indexing for certain brackets, specifying that section 15 does not apply to related rate changes, and increasing specified standard deduction amounts from $18,000 to $23,625, with rate amendments effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025.

#### Page 89

Dollar amounts and dates are updated by replacing $12,000 with $15,750 in subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (B)(ii), substituting 2025 for 2018 and 2024 for 2017 in the specified provisions, with these amendments applying to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. Section 70103 amends section 151(d)(5) to terminate personal exemptions while creating a temporary $6,000 deduction for each qualified individual age 65 or older for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2029, phased out by 6% of modified adjusted gross income over $75,000 ($150,000 joint), defining modified AGI to include income excluded under sections 911, 931, or 933, and requiring the qualified individual's Social Security number.

#### Page 90

Omission of a correct Social Security number required under section 151(d)(5)(C) is treated as a mathematical or clerical error, and these amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. Section 70104 extends the expanded child tax credit, increases the amount from $2,000 to $2,200, requires SSNs for the taxpayer (at least one spouse on a joint return) and each qualifying child with numbers issued by SSA to eligible individuals before the return due date, and indexes the $1,400 refundable limit for inflation for years beginning after 2024.

#### Page 91

Amendments to section 24 provide a post-2025 cost-of-living increase to the $2,200 amount using the section 1(f)(3) adjustment with a 2024 substitution and rounding to the next lowest $100, cap the refundable child credit at $1,400 per qualifying child, treat omission of a correct Social Security number as a mathematical or clerical error, and apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. Section 199A is updated to raise the phase-in thresholds in subsections (b)(3)(B) and (d)(3) from $50,000 ($100,000 joint) to $75,000 ($150,000 joint) and to establish a minimum deduction for active qualified business income under new subsection (i) whereby an applicable taxpayer’s deduction equals the greater of the otherwise determined amount or $400.

#### Page 92

Defines “active qualified trade or business” as one in which the taxpayer materially participates and provides inflation adjustments, starting with taxable years beginning after 2026, for the $400 and $1,000 thresholds using the section 1(f)(3) cost-of-living measure (with calendar year 2025 as the base and rounding to the nearest $5), adds a conforming clause to section 199A(a), and applies these changes to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. It raises the estate and gift tax basic exclusion to $15,000,000 with updated year references and removal of subparagraph (C) effective for decedents and gifts after December 31, 2025, and extends increased AMT exemptions by deleting “before 2026” limitations and revising the inflation adjustment to reference 2026 for the $1,000,000 phase-out amount.

#### Page 93

Amendments to the alternative minimum tax recalibrate specified dollar thresholds by referencing calendar years 2017 and 2025 and increase the phaseout rate from 25% to 50%, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. The law extends and modifies the qualified residence interest and casualty loss deductions by eliminating the prior January 1, 2026 cutoff, treating mortgage insurance premiums as interest, making conforming clause and heading changes, and expanding casualty loss eligibility to State-declared disasters with a new definition enumerating covered natural catastrophes.

#### Page 94

Qualifying disasters are clarified to include specified natural events or any fire, flood, or explosion deemed sufficiently severe by the Governor (or D.C. Mayor) and the Secretary, and “State” is defined to include D.C., Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands, with these changes effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025. The law terminates miscellaneous itemized deductions except for educator expenses—expanded to cover coaches and interscholastic sports administrators, nonathletic supplies for health or physical education, and costs incurred as part of instructional activity without a dollar cap—effective after 2025, and adds a new limitation reducing itemized deductions by 2/37 of the lesser of the deductions or the taxpayer’s taxable income.

#### Page 95

An itemized deduction limitation—applied after other deduction limits and tied to the start of the 37 percent bracket—is disregarded when computing the qualified business income deduction (including for specified agricultural and horticultural cooperative patrons), effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. The page also extends and modifies qualified transportation fringe benefits by removing certain provisions (including bicycle commuting references), changing the inflation-indexing base year to 1997, and revising coordination with expense disallowance rules (effective after December 31, 2025), and extends the post-2017 limitation on moving expense deductions while adding a new exception allowing deductions for relocating members of the intelligence community.

#### Page 96

Section 132(g)(2) is amended to remove the “before January 1, 2026” sunset and retitle the provision “BEGINNING AFTER 2017,” and to allow the exclusion to also cover employees or new appointees of the intelligence community (other than Armed Forces) who relocate due to assignment changes, with these changes applying to tax years beginning after December 31, 2025. The law revises section 165(d) to cap wagering loss deductions at 90 percent of losses and only up to wagering gains (including otherwise allowable deductions incurred in conducting wagering), extends and enhances ABLE account contribution limits by striking the pre-2026 cutoff and modifying the inflation adjustment by substituting 1996 for 1997 in section 2503(b), and begins an extension of the saver’s credit for ABLE contributions by updating section 25B(d)(1), generally effective for years and contributions after 2025.

#### Page 97

Qualified retirement savings contributions are defined to include ABLE account deposits and, for tax years beginning before January 1, 2027, specified retirement contributions (qualified contributions, elective deferrals, eligible 457(b) deferred compensation, and voluntary employee contributions), with SECURE 2.0 Act §103(e)(1) repealed and these changes applying to tax years ending after December 31, 2025; the saver’s credit maximum in §25B is raised from $2,000 to $2,100 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2026. Rollovers from 529 plans to ABLE accounts are extended by removing the prior January 1, 2026 cutoff (effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025), and special tax treatment for individuals serving in the Sinai is made permanent while adding Kenya, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Chad to the qualified hazardous duty areas.

#### Page 98

The law designates the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, Kenya, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Chad as locations eligible for hostile fire or imminent danger special pay under 37 U.S.C. 310, strikes subsections (c) and (d) of section 11026 of Public Law 115-97, and sets an effective date of January 1, 2026. It revises section 108(f)(5) to exclude from gross income discharges of student or private education loans pursuant to specified Higher Education Act provisions or due to death or total and permanent disability, requires inclusion of the taxpayer’s Social Security number on the return for the exclusion to apply (as defined in section 24(h)(7)), and treats omission of a correct Social Security number as a mathematical or clerical error by amending section 6213(g)(2).

#### Page 99

Amendments related to section 108(f)(5)(C) (discharges on account of death or disability) apply to discharges after December 31, 2025. Section 70120 revises the SALT deduction cap by replacing the $10,000 limit with an “applicable limitation amount” of $40,000 in 2025, $40,400 in 2026, increasing 1% annually through 2029 before reverting to $10,000 thereafter, and phasing the cap down by 30% of modified AGI above thresholds ($500,000 in 2025, $505,000 in 2026, then indexed), without reducing it below $10,000 and using half amounts for married filing separately.

#### Page 100

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, taxpayers may deduct qualified tips reported on specified information statements or Form 4137 up to $25,000 per year, with the deductible amount reduced by $100 for each $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income above $150,000 ($300,000 joint), where modified adjusted gross income is AGI increased by amounts excluded under sections 911, 931, or 933. For non-employee trade or business activities, qualified tips are deductible only to the extent business gross income (including such tips) exceeds other allocable deductions, and “qualified tips” means cash tips in occupations that customarily and regularly received tips on or before December 31, 2024, excluding amounts unless they are voluntary, not negotiated, and determined by the payor without consequence for nonpayment.

#### Page 101

It defines cash tips to include cash or charged tips and tips under tip-sharing arrangements, limits the deduction to non-specified service trades while treating employees as in a specified service trade if their employer is one, requires inclusion of the individual's social security number, mandates joint filing for married taxpayers, authorizes anti-abuse regulations, and terminates the deduction after 2028. It further allows non-itemizers to claim the section 224 deduction, treats omission of the required social security number as a mathematical or clerical error, excludes amounts deducted under section 224 from qualified business income under section 199A, and announces an extension of the tip credit to beauty service businesses.

#### Page 102

Section 45B is amended to limit the credit to tips from customary tipping in specific services—providing, delivering, or serving food or beverages and certain personal care services (barbering and hair care, nail care, esthetics, body/spa treatments)—and to revise the minimum wage reference used to determine the credit, specifying that for food and beverage establishments it remains the rate in effect on January 1, 2007. New reporting rules under sections 6041 and 6041A require statements to the Secretary and to payees to separately identify amounts reasonably designated as cash tips and the recipient’s occupation described in section 224(d)(1), including for non-employee compensation and payments for services and direct sales.

#### Page 103

The page amends reporting rules so third party settlement organizations and payors must separately account for amounts designated as cash tips and the recipient’s occupation, requires wage statements to include total cash tips reported by employees, and makes a clerical change establishing Section 224, “Qualified tips.” It directs Treasury to publish within 90 days a list of occupations that customarily received tips as of December 31, 2024, modify withholding procedures for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025 to reflect the Section 224 deduction, sets amendments effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, and permits reasonable methods to approximate separate accounting of cash tips for periods before January 1, 2026.

#### Page 104

A deduction is allowed equal to qualified overtime compensation received during the taxable year and included on specified statements, subject to a cap of $12,500 ($25,000 for a joint return) and reduced by $100 for each $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for a joint return), with modified adjusted gross income defined as AGI increased by amounts excluded under sections 911, 931, or 933. Qualified overtime compensation means Fair Labor Standards Act section 7 overtime pay above the regular rate and excludes qualified tips; the deduction requires the individual’s social security number, applies to married individuals only if filing a joint return, is to be implemented with regulations to prevent abuse, terminates for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2028, and section 63(b) is amended to allow the deduction to non-itemizers.

#### Page 105

Creates a new deduction for qualified overtime compensation (section 225) and requires reporting of the total amount of such qualified overtime on Forms W-2 and in section 6041 statements to both the Secretary and payees, while treating omission of a correct Social Security number required under section 225(d) as a mathematical or clerical error. It updates the Code’s table of sections to include “Sec. 225. Qualified overtime compensation,” directs Treasury to adjust withholding procedures under section 3402 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025 to reflect the deduction, applies the amendments to tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, and allows approximation of separately reported overtime amounts for periods before January 1, 2026.

#### Page 106

For tax years 2025 through 2028, interest on qualified personal-use passenger vehicle loans incurred after December 31, 2024 and secured by a first lien is excluded from nondeductible personal interest, provided the vehicle’s VIN is reported on the tax return. Loans for fleet sales, commercial-use vehicles, lease financing, salvage-title vehicles, or vehicles intended for scrap or parts are excluded; deductible interest is capped at $10,000 per year and reduced by $200 for each $1,000 (or portion thereof) of modified adjusted gross income over $100,000 ($200,000 for joint returns).

#### Page 107

The law defines an "applicable passenger vehicle" as a road-use motor vehicle (car, minivan, van, sport utility vehicle, pickup truck, or motorcycle) with at least two wheels, a gross vehicle weight rating under 14,000 pounds, original use commencing with the taxpayer, treated as a motor vehicle under title II of the Clean Air Act, and finally assembled in the United States, and it provides special rules defining "final assembly," allowing limited first-lien refinancing, and excluding related-party indebtedness. It also amends section 63(b) to let non-itemizers claim so much of the deduction allowed by section 163(a) as is attributable to the exception under section 163(h)(4)(A), and begins a reporting amendment adding a new section to the tax code.

#### Page 108

Any person engaged in a trade or business who receives $600 or more in interest in a calendar year from an individual on a specified passenger vehicle loan must file a return, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, reporting the individual’s name and address, interest received, beginning-of-year outstanding principal, loan origination date, vehicle details (year, make, model, VIN or other description), and any other required information. The filer must furnish the individual a written statement by January 31 of the following year including a contact’s name, address, and phone number and the reported amounts and vehicle details, with terms defined by reference to section 163(h)(4) (including “specified passenger vehicle loan” as in 163(h)(4)(B)), and the Secretary will issue necessary regulations or guidance.

The text adds reporting and penalty provisions for new section 6050AA covering returns and statements on applicable passenger vehicle loan interest received in a trade or business from individuals, provides guidance to prevent duplicate reporting, specifies that no return is required when section 163(h)(4) does not apply, makes conforming amendments (including updating a reference to section 163(h)(5)), and applies these changes to indebtedness incurred after December 31, 2024. It also establishes Trump accounts by adding section 530A to a new Part IX, treating them like traditional IRAs under section 408(a) (not Roth) and defining them as IRAs created or organized by the Secretary for eligible individuals or created in the United States for an individual’s exclusive benefit.

#### Page 110

The page defines requirements for “Trump accounts,” including designation at establishment, possible funding by a qualified rollover contribution, a ban on contributions for 12 months after enactment and on pre-18 contributions above the annual limit, no distributions before the calendar year in which the beneficiary turns 18 (except as in subsection (d)), and a pre-18 investment restriction to eligible investments—mutual funds or ETFs that track a qualified index and do not use leverage. It also defines an eligible individual as someone under age 18 in the year of election with a Social Security number issued before the election, and permits the election to be made by the Secretary based on available information or by another person if no prior election has been made.

#### Page 111

A fund must have annual fees and expenses no greater than 0.1 percent of the invested balance and meet any additional criteria set by the Secretary; a qualified index is the S&P 500 or another index comprised primarily of U.S. equity investments with regulated futures traded on a qualified board or exchange, excluding industry or sector-specific indices but allowing market capitalization-based indices. The account beneficiary is the individual for whom the Trump account is established, and contributions made before the calendar year in which the beneficiary attains age 18 are non-deductible and limited to $5,000 per calendar year excluding exempt contributions (qualified rollover contributions, qualified general contributions, or contributions under section 6434), with post-2027 cost-of-living adjustments per section 1(f)(3) using calendar year 2026 and rounding down to the nearest $100, and section 219(f)(3) timing rules do not apply to such pre-age-18 contributions.

#### Page 112

Distributions from a Trump account are generally barred before the calendar year the beneficiary turns 18, except for qualified rollovers (including a full trustee-to-trustee ABLE rollover in the year the beneficiary turns 17) and distributions of excess contributions, all not included in gross income, though the distributee’s tax is increased by 100 percent of the net income attributable to any excess. For section 72 purposes the investment in the contract excludes qualified general contributions, contributions under section 6434, and amounts excluded under section 128, and if the beneficiary dies before age 18 the distribution ban lifts, the account ceases to be a Trump account at death, and an amount equal to the fair market value of the assets reduced by the investment in the contract on that date is specified.

#### Page 113

Amounts paid are includible in gross income either of the non-estate recipient for the taxable year that includes the payment date or, if paid to the beneficiary’s estate, of the beneficiary for their last taxable year. A qualified rollover contribution is a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer of the entire balance between Trump accounts for the same beneficiary, and a qualified general contribution is a Secretary-made distribution of a general funding contribution from specified governmental or 501(c)(3) entities to a defined class of under-18 account beneficiaries, allocated by dividing the total contribution by the number of beneficiaries in the class, with classes defined by age, specified geographic areas, or specified birth years.

#### Page 114

In selecting trustees for Trump accounts created or organized by the Secretary, the Secretary must weigh the trustee’s record of reliability and regulatory compliance, customer service experience, and costs to the account and beneficiary. Special coordination rules with section 408 are established for Trump accounts—excluding certain subsections before the beneficiary turns 18, substituting Trump account language for custodial accounts, ensuring pre-18 contributions don’t count toward other plan limits, applying distribution rules separately, defining excess contributions for minors with reductions for timely corrective distributions—and trustees must report account information to the Secretary and beneficiaries, including contribution amounts and the source of any contribution over $25.

#### Page 115

The page sets detailed reporting rules for Trump accounts, requiring trustees to report distributions (including qualified rollovers), account fair market value and investment, and to file within 30 days of any qualified rollover a report with beneficiary and trustee identifiers, with reporting ceasing after the calendar year the beneficiary attains age 17. It revises ABLE account provisions to exclude qualified ABLE rollover contributions (referenced in section 530A(d)(4)(B)) from contribution limits and excess-contribution penalties, extends failure-to-file penalties to Trump account reports, adds "PART IX-TRUMP ACCOUNTS" to the table of parts for subchapter F of chapter 1, and begins a new section on employer contributions.

#### Page 116

The Act adds IRC section 128 to exclude from an employee’s gross income employer contributions to the employee’s or a dependent’s Trump account made under a qualifying employer plan, capped at $2,500 with post-2027 cost-of-living adjustments (rounded down to the nearest $100) and subject to plan requirements paralleling section 129(d)(2), (3), (6), (7), and (8), with a conforming table-of-sections amendment. It also adds section 139J to exclude from an account beneficiary’s gross income any qualified general contribution to a Trump account (using definitions from section 530A), makes related clerical amendments, and initiates a Trump Accounts Contribution Pilot Program by adding a new section to subchapter B of chapter 65.

#### Page 117

Creates a Trump Accounts Contribution Pilot Program under which an individual may elect a $1,000 deemed income tax payment for an eligible child—defined as a qualifying U.S.-citizen child born in 2025–2028 with no prior election—which the Secretary deposits into the child’s Trump account. Elections must include the child’s Social Security number, payments are protected from federal offsets and accrue no interest before January 1, 2028, mirror-code possessions may opt in, and the law adds a penalty for negligent or fraudulent claims.

#### Page 118

The law creates IRC section 6659 imposing a $500 penalty for negligence/disregard or $1,000 for fraud when a taxpayer improperly elects under section 6434 for a non-eligible child with respect to the Trump accounts contribution pilot program credit, defines terms by reference to sections 6434 and 6662, treats omission of a correct Social Security number required by section 6434(e)(1) as a mathematical or clerical error, makes conforming table-of-sections updates, applies the amendments to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, and appropriates $410,000,000 through September 30, 2034 to implement them. Chapter 3 begins business tax reforms with Section 70301 making full expensing permanent by amending section 168(k)(2)(A) to revise punctuation in clauses (i) and (ii) and strike clause (iii).

#### Page 119

The statute revises IRC §168(k) by reorganizing rules for longer production period and self-constructed property, expanding the plant provision to any plant “planted or grafted,” and making conforming cross-reference changes, including limiting §460(c)(6)(B) to property with a recovery period of 7 years or less. It replaces the “applicable percentage” with 100 percent expensing for qualified property and specified plants, strikes §168(k)(6) and (8), and permits a transitional election for the first taxable year ending after January 19, 2025 to use reduced percentages—40 percent generally, 60 percent for property described in §168(k)(2)(B) or (C), and 40 percent for specified plants.

#### Page 120

The amendments apply generally to property acquired after January 19, 2025, with specified plants covered if planted or grafted after that date, a transitional reduced percentage election applying to taxable years ending after January 19, 2025, and acquisition determined by the date of a written binding contract. Section 70302 adds IRC section 174A to permit a current deduction for domestic research or experimental expenditures (excluding foreign research), and allows a taxpayer election to instead capitalize and amortize certain such expenditures over at least 60 months beginning when benefits are first realized, if made by the tax return filing deadline and then adhered to.

#### Page 121

An election to treat expenditures applies prospectively only, with special rules excluding the acquisition or improvement of land and property subject to depreciation or depletion and mineral exploration (while treating section 167 and 611 allowances as expenditures), and treating software development costs as research or experimental expenditures. Coordination amendments shift section 174 to foreign research or experimental expenditures amortized over 15 years, update headings and “no deduction or reduction to amount realized” language, and revise the research credit to reference domestic research under section 174A and amend section 280C(c)(1).

#### Page 122

Domestic research or experimental expenditures under section 174A must be reduced by the section 41 research credit, AMT rules in section 56(b)(2) are revised to distinguish domestic (174A) and foreign (174) R&E, and section 59(e)(2)(B) is updated to permit an optional 10-year writeoff for 174A amounts. Conforming amendments insert 174A references in provisions on qualified small issue bonds, startup and capital expenditures, active business computer software royalties, source rules, basis adjustments, and qualified small business stock, differentiating domestic expenditures under 174A from foreign expenditures under 174.

#### Page 123

The amendments are treated as a taxpayer-initiated, Secretary-consented change in accounting method under section 481, applied on a cut-off basis to domestic research or experimental expenditures in tax years beginning after December 31, 2024 without section 481(a) adjustments, while straddle years use a modified cut-off with section 481(a) adjustments only for nondeducted domestic expenditures of that year. A clerical amendment adds section 174A, and effective dates include general applicability to amounts in tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, application to foreign research expenditure dispositions after May 12, 2025, coordination with the research credit for years beginning after December 31, 2024, and no-inference rules for prior periods.

#### Page 124

An eligible taxpayer (meeting the section 448(c) gross receipts test and not a tax shelter under section 448(a)(3)) may, within one year of enactment, elect to apply paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (e) retroactively by substituting December 31, 2021 for December 31, 2024, file amended returns, have the election treated as a taxpayer-initiated, consented change in accounting under section 481 with subsection (c) inapplicable, and make or revoke a section 280C(c)(2) research credit election timely on an amended return during that same one-year period. Separately, for domestic research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021 and before January 1, 2025 that were capitalized, a taxpayer may elect to deduct any remaining unamortized amount either in full in the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2024 or ratably over the two taxable years beginning with that year.

#### Page 125

Taxpayers making the specified election are treated as changing their accounting method under section 481 with deemed consent, applied on a cut-off basis with no section 481(a) adjustments, and Treasury must issue guidance, including allowing the deduction for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 and ending before enactment. The law modifies section 163(j) by removing a pre-2022 limitation and extending floor plan financing to certain trailers and campers, applies these changes to tax years beginning after December 31, 2024 with special rules for short years, and amends section 45S to let eligible employers elect a paid family and medical leave credit based on either a percentage of wages or an insurance policy arrangement.

#### Page 126

The law amends the paid family and medical leave credit by clarifying that the applicable percentage for employer-provided insurance is based on premiums and the policy’s rate of payment without regard to whether leave was used, replacing “credit allowed” with “wages taken into account,” updating aggregation rules to treat related entities as a single employer with limited exceptions (excluding reasons like separate lines of business, wage rates, job categories, or state/local law differences but potentially allowing grouping of common-law employees), and stating that State- or local-paid/mandated leave counts toward employer-provided leave but not toward the federal credit. It also revises employee eligibility by allowing an employer election of a 6-month (rather than 1-year) service requirement, requiring compensation to be determined on an annualized pro‑rata basis for part-time employees, and adding a minimum customary employment of at least 20 hours per week.

#### Page 127

It amends the tax code by striking a subsection and revising section 280C(a) to prevent a double benefit by disallowing a deduction for the portion of paid family and medical leave insurance premiums equal to the credit determined under section 45S(a)(1)(B) (updating the cross-reference to 45S(a)(1)(A)), effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. It also creates exceptions to the business meals deduction limits—including full deductibility for meals on certain fishing vessels or at specified fish processing facilities north of 50° N and outside MSAs—effective for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2025, and raises section 179 expensing caps to $2,500,000 with a $4,000,000 phase-out threshold with conforming 2025/2024 indexing adjustments.

#### Page 128

Amendments change a calendar-year reference to 2017 and apply to property placed in service in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. A new elective special allowance in section 168(n) allows a 100 percent first-year depreciation with basis reduction for designated qualified production property—being portions of nonresidential real property integral to qualified production activities, placed in service in the U.S. or its possessions with original use by the taxpayer, constructed between January 19, 2025 and January 1, 2029, and placed in service before January 1, 2031—with a rule that lessee use does not qualify for a lessor and a special rule for certain acquired property not previously used in such activities.

#### Page 129

The page defines key terms for a deduction related to qualified production property, excluding portions of nonresidential real property used for offices, administrative services, lodging, parking, sales, research, software development, engineering, or other unrelated functions; it specifies that qualified production activity requires substantial transformation, limits “production” to agricultural and chemical production, and defines a qualified product as tangible personal property other than food or beverages prepared in the same building as a retail establishment where sold. It establishes acquisition and timing rules using written binding contracts to determine whether property falls within the January 1, 2021–May 12, 2025 window, requires that the property was not previously used by the taxpayer and meets section 179(d)(2)(A)–(C) and (3), applies syndication rules by reference, authorizes the Secretary to extend the placed-in-service deadline due to acts of God, and provides that the section 167 deduction for such property is used in computing alternative minimum taxable income under section 55 without section 56 adjustments.

#### Page 130

Qualified production property is treated as a separate class of property for certain special depreciation allowances with a deemed taxpayer election, but it excludes property subject to the alternative depreciation system and is treated as separate nonresidential real property for specified purposes. If within 10 years the property ceases the specified qualifying use, section 1245 recapture applies via a deemed disposition with corresponding basis and depreciation adjustments; elections must specify the nonresidential real property and designated portion, be made on the tax return, are irrevocable absent extraordinary circumstances and Secretary consent, and the Secretary is directed to issue regulations including rules defining substantial transformation consistent with section 954(d).

#### Page 131

The page modifies tax code to include qualified production property as section 1245 property (applying to property placed in service after enactment) and clarifies that change-in-use rules apply to transferees after fully or partially tax-free transfers, while increasing the section 48D advanced manufacturing investment credit from 25 percent to 35 percent for property placed in service after December 31, 2025. It further updates exempt facility bond rules to treat spaceports like airports, adds a special rule treating spaceport property on federally leased land as government-owned when lease requirements are met, and defines “spaceport,” “space cargo,” and “spacecraft,” specifying covered activities at or near launch or reentry sites including manufacturing/repair, flight control, launch and reentry services, and crew/cargo transfers.

#### Page 132

Amends tax-exempt facility bond rules to explicitly include spaceports (using 51 U.S.C. 50902 definitions), state that a spaceport need not be open to the general public, permit manufacturing facilities and industrial parks as qualifying spaceport property, and specify that bonds are not treated as federally guaranteed merely due to federal user payments, with a conforming heading change and applicability to obligations issued after enactment. Also revises foreign tax credit limitation rules by adding section 904(b)(5) to allocate section 250(a)(1)(B) and related section 164(a)(3) deductions to foreign-source net CFC tested income, allocate no interest or R&E expenses to such income, allow only directly allocable other deductions, require otherwise allocable amounts to be assigned to U.S.-source income, and amend section 904(d)(2)(H)(i) to reference paragraph (1)(D).

#### Page 133

Amendments change cross-references in sections 904 and 951A and, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, raise the deemed paid foreign tax credit under section 960(d)(1) and the section 78 gross-up from 80 percent to 90 percent. They also disallow a foreign tax credit for 10 percent of taxes on distributions of previously taxed net CFC tested income excluded under section 959(a) by reason of section 951A(a) (applicable to amounts after June 28, 2025), and add a new source rule in section 904(b)(6) for income from U.S.-produced inventory sold outside the United States through foreign branches.

#### Page 134

Income from the sale or exchange of inventory property attributable to an office or other fixed place of business to which the third sentence of section 863(b) applies is treated as foreign-source, capped at 50 percent of such income, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Section 250 is amended to reduce deduction percentages to 33.34 percent and 40 percent and to strike paragraph (3), and to include income and gain from sales or other dispositions (including deemed transactions and those under section 367(d)) of intangible property and other property subject to depreciation, amortization, or depletion in deduction-eligible income, with conforming changes and effective dates for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025 and for sales after June 16, 2025.

#### Page 135

Section 250(b)(3)(A)(ii) is amended to treat expenses and deductions (including taxes) properly allocable to gross income, excluding interest expense and research or experimental expenditures, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Section 70323 replaces references to “global intangible low-taxed income” with “net CFC tested income,” repeals subsections (b) and (d) of section 951A concerning the tax-free deemed return on foreign investments, and makes conforming changes to Sections 250, 951A, 960(d)(2), and related headings and tables.

#### Page 136

Amends IRC section 250 to replace “foreign-derived intangible income” with “foreign-derived deduction eligible income,” reorganizes subsection (b) (striking former (1)–(2), redesignating (4)–(5) as (1)–(2) with a cross-reference fix), updates related headings and table entries, and applies beginning after December 31, 2025. Raises the base erosion minimum tax in section 59A from 10% to 10.5%, eliminates prior paragraph (2) and redesignates subsequent paragraphs with conforming cross-reference changes (including 59A(e)(1)(C)) and revises “registered securities dealer” to “securities dealer registered.”

#### Page 137

Technical cross-reference corrections are made to section 59A (including replacing references to section 6038B(b)(2) with 6038A(b)(2) and updating subsection references from (g) to (h)), effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Section 163(j) is revised to coordinate the business interest limitation with interest capitalization by applying the limitation whether interest would be deducted or capitalized, treating deduction references as including capitalization, applying allowed amounts first to capitalized interest, excluding carried-forward disallowed interest from future capitalization treatment, defining interest capitalization provisions, and clarifying that interest capitalized under sections 263(g) or 263A(f) is not business interest.

#### Page 138

It authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations under section 163(j), including determining which business interest is taken into account for that subsection and section 59A(c)(3), and revises adjusted taxable income to include amounts under sections 951(a), 951A(a), and 78 and related deductions under sections 245A and 250, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. It permanently extends the look-through rule for related controlled foreign corporations by removing the sunset in section 954(c)(6)(C) (effective for foreign corporation years beginning after 2025) and repeals the one-month deferral election for specified foreign corporations in section 898(c), effective for years beginning after November 30, 2025, with a transition aligning the first post-November 2025 year-end to the first required year.

#### Page 139

The change is treated as initiated by the corporation and consented to by the Secretary, who must issue regulations or guidance to allocate foreign taxes paid or accrued between the first and succeeding taxable years, with "Secretary" defined as the Secretary of the Treasury or delegate. Section 70353 amends section 958(b) to restore the bar on downward attribution of stock from non-U.S. persons to U.S. persons and adds new section 951B, which applies Subpart F (other than sections 951A, 951(b), and 957) with specified substitutions and applies section 951A to foreign controlled U.S. shareholders of foreign controlled foreign corporations.

#### Page 140

The page defines foreign controlled entities by modifying the controlled foreign corporation and shareholder tests (including a higher ownership threshold and adjusted attribution rules), directs Treasury to issue regulations including for reporting and coordination with PFIC rules, and adds new section 951B to the subpart F table. It makes the amendments effective for foreign corporations’ tax years beginning after December 31, 2025, includes a special rule treating references to U.S. shareholders and CFCs as including their foreign controlled counterparts (with terms defined by amended subpart F), provides a no inference clause for prior years, and then introduces modifications to section 951’s pro rata share rules.

#### Page 141

U.S. shareholders of a controlled foreign corporation must include in gross income their pro rata share of the corporation’s subpart F income and section 956 amounts for the CFC year, with the pro rata share tied to stock ownership and periods when the shareholder and corporation meet the required statuses, and inclusion occurring in the shareholder’s taxable year that includes the last day of ownership during the CFC year. The Secretary is authorized to issue regulations, including allowing or requiring a CFC to close its taxable year upon stock disposition, and section 951A(b) is amended to remove parenthetical language about tested income determinations tied to each CFC taxable year ending in or with a U.S. shareholder’s taxable year.

#### Page 142

The law revises section 951A(c) pro rata share timing by referencing section 951(a)(3) and measuring CFC status on any day in the taxable year, makes these changes effective for CFC taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, and provides a transition rule under which certain dividends paid on or before June 28, 2025 when the U.S. shareholder did not own the CFC during the pre-June 28 portion, or paid after June 28, 2025 and before the first post-2025 CFC year, are not treated as dividends under former section 951(a)(2)(B) if they do not increase a U.S. person’s taxable income. It also enhances the employer-provided child care credit by raising the credit rate on qualified expenditures from 25% to 40% (50% for eligible small businesses) and amending section 45F(b)’s dollar limitation.

#### Page 143

Amendments to section 45F cap the employer-provided child care credit at $500,000 ($600,000 for eligible small businesses) with post-2026 inflation indexing, define eligible small businesses using a modified 5-year gross receipts test under section 448(c), allow credits for services via intermediate entities and for jointly owned or operated facilities, require Treasury guidance, and take effect for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2025. Section 70402 enhances the adoption credit by making up to $5,000 refundable and updating inflation adjustment rules in section 23(h).

#### Page 144

The page revises the adoption credit by indexing certain dollar amounts to a cost-of-living adjustment with rounding and a special rule for the refundable portion, excludes the refundable portion from carryforward, and recognizes Indian tribal governments alongside States in determining special-needs status, with these changes effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024. It increases the Dependent Care Assistance Program exclusion from $5,000 ($2,500) to $7,500 ($3,750), effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025, and amends the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to define an applicable percentage starting at 50% that phases down as adjusted gross income exceeds $15,000 (not below 35% initially and not below 20% after a further reduction by $2,000 increments, $4,000 for joint returns).

#### Page 145

An amendment addressing adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns) applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, and a new federal income tax credit (section 25F) is created for individuals’ qualified contributions to scholarship granting organizations. The credit equals total qualified contributions but is capped at $1,700 and reduced by any State credit, and key definitions include covered States that elect to participate and list organizations, eligible students with household income at or below 300 percent of area median and eligible for public school, qualified contributions as cash to listed in-State scholarship organizations, and qualified education expenses as those in section 530(b)(3)(A).

#### Page 146

A "scholarship granting organization" is defined as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, non-private foundation that maintains separate accounts for qualified contributions, meets subsection (d), and is listed for the applicable covered State under subsection (g). To qualify, it must award scholarships to at least 10 students across more than one school, spend at least 90% of income on scholarships for qualified elementary or secondary education expenses, prioritize prior recipients and then eligible students with a sibling previously awarded by the organization, avoid earmarking contributions, verify family income and size and limit awards to households meeting subsection (c)(2)(A), refrain from self-dealing (no scholarships to disqualified persons per rules similar to section 4946), and any contribution receiving the credit cannot also be deducted under section 170, with carryforward of unused credit provided.

#### Page 147

It allows any excess credit over the section 26(a) limitation (reduced by specified other credits) to be carried forward, but no later than the fifth succeeding taxable year with credits used on a first-in, first-out basis; requires participating states, through the Governor or authorized designee, to submit by January 1 an annual certified list of qualifying scholarship granting organizations; and directs the Secretary to issue regulations for enforcement, recordkeeping, and information reporting. Conforming amendments add new section 25F on qualified elementary and secondary education scholarships, and a new section 139K excludes from gross income amounts provided as scholarships for qualified elementary or secondary education expenses of eligible students.

#### Page 148

Creates an exclusion from gross income for scholarships covering qualified elementary or secondary education expenses of eligible students provided by scholarship granting organizations, defines terms by reference to section 25F(c), adds section 139K, and sets effective dates for taxable years and amounts after December 31, 2026. It removes the sunset on employer payments of student loans and indexes the $5,250 educational assistance limit for inflation beginning after 2026 (effective for payments after December 31, 2025), and expands section 529 so that elementary and secondary school tuition counts as a qualified higher education expense.

#### Page 149

The law expands qualified education expenses to include curriculum and instructional materials, online materials, qualified tutoring, fees for standardized/AP/college entrance exams, dual enrollment fees, and licensed educational therapies for students with disabilities, with the amendment applying to distributions made after enactment. It increases the section 529(e)(3) limitation from $10,000 to $20,000 effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, and treats certain postsecondary credentialing expenses as qualified higher education expenses by defining covered tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and comparable costs for recognized credential programs.

#### Page 150

Eligible costs include fees for required testing and continuing education, and a "recognized postsecondary credential program" is one on a State WIOA list, in the VA WEAMS directory, recognized by a reputable exam-granting organization as preparation for a required exam, or designated by the Secretary after consulting the Secretary of Labor. A "recognized postsecondary credential" includes industry-recognized employment credentials accredited by specified bodies or listed in DoD COOL or designated by the Secretary, registered apprenticeship completion certificates, State or Federal occupational or professional licenses (and certifications required to obtain them), and WIOA-defined credentials provided through an approved program.

#### Page 151

The amendments made by this section apply to distributions made after the date of enactment. Section 4968 is rewritten to impose an excise tax on private colleges and universities equal to 1.4%, 4%, or 8% of net investment income depending on student adjusted endowment levels, defines which institutions qualify (eligible institutions with at least 3,000 tuition-paying students, over 50% in the U.S., and endowments of at least $500,000, excluding state institutions), sets how student adjusted endowment and student counts are calculated, and determines net investment income under rules similar to section 4940(c) including student loan interest.

#### Page 152

Federally-subsidized royalty income—royalties from patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property resulting from student or faculty work at an educational institution and created with any federal funds—must be included as gross investment income when determining net investment income, with federal funds including grants and contract payments to the institution, related organizations, or the relevant individuals. Assets and net investment income of related organizations are attributed to the educational institution for specified purposes, subject to limits on double counting and exclusion of amounts not intended or available for the institution unless the organization is controlled by the institution or is a section 509(a)(3) supporting organization, and the Secretary is directed to issue regulations or guidance to prevent avoidance of the tax.

#### Page 153

It requires applicable educational institutions subject to the section 4968 excise tax to report the numbers of tuition-paying and total students on their annual return and directs measures to prevent avoidance of that tax via endowment restructuring, and it expands the section 4960 definition of covered employee to include any current or former employee who was employed in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, with these changes applying to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. It also revises Opportunity Zone rules to adopt a decennial designation schedule beginning July 1, 2026 and every ten years thereafter and repeals the special rule for Puerto Rico.

#### Page 154

The Act amends section 1400Z-1 to clarify that limits on the number of qualified opportunity zone designations apply during any period, with most changes effective upon enactment and a Puerto Rico-specific amendment effective December 31, 2026. It redefines “low-income community” using median family income and poverty thresholds, repeals the rule for contiguous census tracts, and provides that designations remain in effect for 10 years from the applicable start date.

#### Page 155

The amendments apply to areas designated under section 1400Z-1 after enactment and repeal the sunset on the election by providing that no election may be made if a prior election for the same sale or exchange is in effect. Section 1400Z-2(b) is rewritten to include deferred gain in income at the earlier of disposition or five years after investment; compute the includible amount as the lesser of excluded gain or the investment’s fair market value reduced by basis; set basis at zero subject to increases for recognized gain and a 10 percent (30 percent for qualified rural opportunity funds) step-up for investments held at least five years; and treat such basis increases as occurring before the five-year inclusion date.

#### Page 156

The page defines a “qualified rural opportunity fund” as a qualified opportunity fund holding at least 90% of its assets in qualified opportunity zone property used substantially in zones comprised entirely of rural areas—either direct business property or stock/partnership interests in businesses whose tangible property qualifies—and defines “rural area” as areas outside cities over 50,000 people and their contiguous urbanized areas. It also amends the 10-year holding rule so basis equals fair market value on sale if sold before 30 years or at the 30-year mark otherwise, and replaces prior date references with an “applicable start date” or “applicable date,” adding a new subparagraph to define the latter.

#### Page 157

The text amends opportunity zone rules by lowering the substantial improvement requirement for existing structures in rural-area zones to 50% of adjusted basis and sets effective dates so most changes apply to investments and property acquired after December 31, 2026, while the rural improvement change is effective upon enactment. It also establishes new Section 6039K requiring qualified opportunity funds to file annual returns reporting specified information, including fund identity and entity type, total assets and qualified opportunity zone property values on specified dates, and for each QOZ stock or partnership holding the investee’s identity and applicable NAICS codes.

#### Page 158

The provisions require Qualified Opportunity Funds to report detailed information about their portfolio corporations and partnerships and the fund’s qualified opportunity zone business property, including relevant census tracts, NAICS codes, investment amounts and aggregate property values on specified dates, whether property is owned or leased, counts of any residential units, and approximate average monthly full-time equivalent employees or other employment-impact indicators set by the Secretary. They must also report details for each investor who disposed of an investment during the year (name, address, taxpayer identification number, acquisition and disposal dates, and amounts), provide any additional information the Secretary may require, and furnish written statements to those investors.

#### Page 159

The section requires statements to include the contact’s name, address, and phone number and the information required by subsection (b)(8), defines full-time equivalent employees by combining full-time counts with non-full-time hours divided by 120, and extends annual return and statement obligations to qualified rural opportunity funds with specified substitutions referencing section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(C). Section 6039L mandates that applicable qualified opportunity zone businesses—those that are trades of a qualified opportunity fund or in which such a fund holds qualified opportunity zone stock or partnership interests—provide written statements with information prescribed by the Secretary to enable fund compliance with section 6039K(b)(5), with terms adopting meanings from subchapter Z of chapter 1.

#### Page 160

Applicable qualified rural opportunity zone businesses must furnish the written statement under subsection (a), substituting "qualified rural opportunity" for "qualified opportunity" and treating references to rural zone stock, partnership interests, or businesses as those described in section 1400Z-2(b)(2)(C)(i). A new IRC section 6726 imposes penalties for failing to timely file complete and correct section 6039K returns relating to qualified opportunity and qualified rural opportunity funds—$500 per day (capped at $10,000 per return, or $50,000 for funds with gross assets over $10,000,000), increased for intentional disregard to $2,500 per day with caps of $50,000 and $250,000 respectively—with all dollar amounts indexed for inflation for returns required to be filed in calendar years beginning after 2025.

#### Page 161

The law establishes rounding rules for adjusted dollar amounts (penalties to the next lowest $10, asset thresholds to the next lowest $10,000, and other amounts to the next lowest $1,000), expands information reporting to include dispositions of qualified opportunity fund investments and information from qualified opportunity zone and qualified rural opportunity zone businesses, mandates electronic filing for returns by such funds, and adds new sections 6039K, 6039L, and a penalty provision under section 6726. The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after enactment, and $15,000,000 is appropriated, available through September 30, 2028, for the Secretary to report data on opportunity zone and rural opportunity zone tax incentives.

#### Page 162

The Secretary of the Treasury must make publicly available an initial and annual report on qualified opportunity funds detailing, to the extent available, the number of funds, total assets, investments by NAICS code, the share of opportunity zone tracts receiving investments, employment impacts by tract, the proportion invested in real property versus other property, the number of residential units created, and aggregate investments by tract. Beginning with the sixth year after enactment, the reports must also present impacts and outcomes measured by economic indicators such as job creation, poverty reduction, and new business starts, and in the sixth and eleventh year reports include additional comparative information for tracts designated as qualified opportunity zones.

#### Page 163

The Secretary must report aggregate comparisons of specified socioeconomic and housing factors across two 5-year periods and, for qualified opportunity zone census tracts, compare those tracts to similar non-designated tracts, with authority to combine tracts into appropriate control groups. The listed factors include unemployment, employment and nonresident workers, poverty, median family income, demographics, rent burden, housing stock and homeownership, property values, affordable units, new business starts, and NAICS employee distribution, and the Secretary must establish procedures to prevent disclosure of identifiable taxpayer or competitive or proprietary information.

#### Page 164

Definitions from Subchapter Z of the Internal Revenue Code apply, the Secretary may aggregate census tracts to protect taxpayer information, and separate public reports on qualified rural opportunity funds must mirror opportunity zone reporting with substitutions for terminology and statutory references. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit is permanently enhanced by amending IRC Section 42 to increase the state housing credit ceiling for calendar years after 2025 (using a 1.12 factor) and to revise the tax-exempt bond financing rule with a special rule when at least 50% of a building’s basis is bond-financed or, under additional conditions for issues after 2025, when at least 25% is financed.

#### Page 165

A minimum financing requirement of at least 5 percent of a building and its land’s aggregate basis applies to buildings placed in service in tax years beginning after December 31, 2025, with rehabilitation expenditures treated as placed in service under section 42(e)(4) for both the existing and separate new building; the New Markets Tax Credit is made permanent for calendar years after 2019 and carryover of unused allocation is limited to five years (with any pre-2026 excess treated as occurring in 2025), effective for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2025. It permanently reinstates and expands the partial deduction for charitable contributions by non-itemizers to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint filers) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, and adds a 0.5 percent floor so deductions are allowed only to the extent aggregate contributions exceed 0.5 percent of the taxpayer’s contribution base.

#### Page 166

For a taxable year, the rule is applied by taking into account charitable contributions in the following order: those under subparagraphs (D), (C), (B), (E), (A), and then (G). The amendments add subparagraph (C) to section 170(d)(1) to govern carryforwards of amounts disallowed by the 0.5-percent floor in subsection (b)(1)(I) (defining the relevant carryover rules), coordinate this with the nonitemizer deduction in section 170(p), and modify the limitation for cash contributions in section 170(b)(1)(G).

#### Page 167

Revises IRC §170(b)(1) to limit cash charitable deductions to the excess of 60% of the taxpayer’s contribution base over amounts already taken under subparagraph (A) and to adjust coordination among subparagraphs (A), (B), and (G), with these amendments applying to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Establishes a 1% floor and 10% ceiling on corporate charitable contribution deductions under §170(b)(2)(A) and amends §170(d)(2) regarding corporate carryforwards.

#### Page 168

The page sets rules for charitable contribution carryforwards, including a five-year limit with FIFO treatment, allowing carryforwards disallowed by the 1-percent floor only from years exceeding the 10 percent limitation, and reducing carryforwards to avoid increasing net operating loss carryovers, with conforming amendments to section 170(b)(2) effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. It permanently raises the cover-over limitation on distilled spirits to $13.25 for spirits entering the United States after December 31, 2025, and provides that specified entities engaged in fisheries participation or investment in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands are to have such activities considered substantially related to their section 501(a) exempt purposes for subchapter F, subject to conditions not specified on this page.

#### Page 169

The text defines fisheries-related activities in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands to include harvesting, processing, transportation, sales, and marketing, and allows nonrecognition of gain on transfers within 18 months from wholly owned subsidiaries to eligible Magnuson-Stevens community development quota entities, with the subsidiary’s income from the transferred trade or business exempt from tax, effective for the duration of that program. It also raises the charitable deduction cap for Native Alaskan subsistence whaling expenses from $10,000 to $50,000 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, and revises IRC section 460(e) to extend the percentage-of-completion exception to “residential construction contracts,” substitute a 3-year completion period for certain non-home contracts with conforming redesignations, and update the AMT cross-reference in section 56(a)(3).

#### Page 170

Amendments concerning residential construction contracts take effect for contracts entered into in taxable years beginning after the Act’s enactment. Section 70431 phases in the exclusion for gain on qualified small business stock by amending section 1202 to allow noncorporate taxpayers a 50% exclusion for stock acquired on or before the applicable date and held over 5 years, and for stock acquired after that date a 50% exclusion after 3 years, 75% after 4 years, and 100% after 5 years, defines the applicable date as the paragraph’s enactment date with acquisition date set as the first day the stock was held after applying section 1223, and continues treatment as not an item of tax preference under section 57(a)(7).

#### Page 171

Conforming amendments to section 1202 revise cross-references, remove §1202(a)(4)(C), and change the holding period for qualified small business stock to at least 3 years (more than 5 years for stock acquired on or before the applicable date), with amendments generally effective for taxable years beginning after enactment and the continued treatment as not an item of tax preference under paragraph (4) taking effect as if included in the 2010 Act. The per-issuer limit is increased by amending §1202(b)(1)(A) to use an applicable dollar limit and adding §1202(b)(4), which sets a per-taxable-year cap of $10,000,000 for stock acquired on or before the applicable date and $15,000,000 for stock acquired after it, each reduced by eligible gains previously taken into account from dispositions of that corporation’s stock.

#### Page 172

Establishes an inflation adjustment beginning after 2026 for the $15,000,000 limit in paragraph (4)(B) (using the section 1(f)(3) cost-of-living factor with a 2025 substitution and rounding to the nearest $10,000), provides that once a taxpayer’s eligible gain from post‑applicable‑date stock dispositions exceeds that limit in a year the applicable dollar limit is zero for subsequent years, and modifies separate returns so a married individual uses a $5,000,000 cap under paragraph (4)(A) and one-half the paragraph (4)(B) amount, effective for taxable years beginning after enactment. It also raises the aggregate gross assets threshold in section 1202(d)(1)(A) and (B) from $50,000,000 to $75,000,000 with a similar inflation adjustment after 2026 (rounded to the nearest $10,000), and applies these changes to stock issued after the date of enactment.

#### Page 173

Reinstates the pre–American Rescue Plan Act de minimis exception under section 6050W(e), requiring third party settlement organizations to report third party network transactions only when aggregate payments exceed $20,000 and more than 200 transactions, effective as if included in section 9674 of the American Rescue Plan Act, and amends section 3406(b) so backup withholding treats such payments as reportable only when those calendar-year thresholds are met, with an exception if prior-year payments were reportable, effective for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2024. Increases the section 6041(a) information reporting threshold for certain payees from $600 to $2,000.

#### Page 174

It indexes the section 6041 information reporting threshold to inflation for calendar years after 2026 using the section 1(f)(3) cost-of-living adjustment with a 2025 base year and rounding to the nearest $100, aligns section 6041A(a)(2) and section 3406(b)(6) (including headings) to that variable threshold, makes conforming changes to section 6041(a) (including using “calendar year”), and applies these changes to payments made after December 31, 2025. It also adds qualified sound recording productions to section 181 expensing with a $150,000 cap per production and on the annual aggregate of such productions, and revises related provisions to prohibit other deductions or amortization for expensed sound recording costs and to conform the election language.

#### Page 175

The Act amends Internal Revenue Code section 181 to add qualified sound recording productions to the list of eligible productions, defines them as sound recordings produced and recorded in the United States under 17 U.S.C. §101, updates termination and redesignates subsections, and changes the heading and table entry to "Treatment of certain qualified productions." It also modifies section 168 bonus depreciation to include qualified sound recording productions as qualified property and to deem them placed in service at initial release or broadcast, sets an effective date for productions commencing in taxable years ending after enactment, and introduces a new section on excluding interest on loans secured by rural or agricultural real property.

#### Page 176

Section 139L excludes 25 percent of the interest received by a qualified lender on any qualified real estate loan from gross income. Qualified lenders include FDIC-insured banks or savings associations, state- or federally regulated insurance companies, U.S.-organized and U.S.-based subsidiaries wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by bank or insurance holding companies, and, for interest on loans secured by real estate described in subsection (c)(3)(A), a federally chartered instrumentality under the Farm Credit Act; a qualified real estate loan is secured by rural or agricultural real estate (or a leasehold mortgage on it), made to a person other than a specified foreign entity after enactment, with rural/ag status determined when interest accrues and a refinancing rule excluding, to that extent, proceeds used to refinance pre-enactment loans, including through a series of refinancings.

#### Page 177

New section 139L defines agricultural real property (including fishing, seafood processing, and aquaculture facilities within U.S. States or possessions) and coordinates with section 265 by treating qualified real estate loans as tax-exempt obligations for limited purposes using 25 percent substitutions for interest, basis, and indebtedness, effective for taxable years ending after enactment. It also reduces federal transfer and making taxes so that only machineguns and destructive devices are subject to the $200 tax while all other firearms are taxed at $0, with a conforming change to section 4182 to deem firearms described in section 5811(a)(2) as having paid the section 5811 tax.

#### Page 178

Amendments take effect for calendar quarters beginning more than 90 days after enactment, and a new IRC section 1062 allows taxpayers with gain from selling qualified farmland to qualified farmers to elect to pay the applicable net tax liability in four equal installments. The provision sets installment due dates tied to tax return deadlines, accelerates remaining payments upon late payment, death (for individuals), or liquidation/cessation events for C corporations, trusts, and estates (with an exception if a buyer assumes liability), and prorates any assessed deficiency across the installments.

#### Page 179

Sets rules for prorating and collecting tax deficiencies with installments (collecting with future installments and paying upon notice for past-due ones), excludes cases involving negligence, intentional disregard, or fraud, and requires any election under subsection (a) by the return due date, with partnership and S corporation sales elected at the partner or shareholder level subject to regulations or guidance. Defines applicable net tax liability as the excess of a taxpayer’s net income tax over the amount computed without the sale gain, net income tax as regular tax liability reduced by credits under subparts A, B, and D, and qualified farmland property as U.S. real property used or leased for farming for substantially all of the prior 10 years and restricted to farm use for 10 years after the sale with look-through to owners of partnerships or S corporations, and adopts section 2032A(e) definitions for farm and farming purposes.

#### Page 180

The act defines a qualified farmer by reference to 7 U.S.C. 1308-1(b) and (c), requires taxpayers electing special gain treatment on sales to include a copy of the covenant or enforceable restriction with their return, and makes a clerical change adding section 1062 on gains from sales of qualified farmland to qualified farmers effective for taxable years beginning after enactment. It extends disaster-related personal casualty loss relief by updating the enactment date reference, terminates the previously-owned and new clean vehicle credits for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025 with conforming amendments, and increases the REIT taxable subsidiary asset test from 20% to 25% for taxable years beginning after 2025.

#### Page 181

The page accelerates terminations of multiple energy-related tax incentives by revising the Internal Revenue Code, including ending the qualified commercial clean vehicles credit on September 30, 2025, the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit on June 30, 2026, the energy efficient commercial buildings deduction for construction beginning after June 30, 2026, and the new energy efficient home credit on June 30, 2026, while modifying the applicability of the energy efficient home improvement and residential clean energy credits and removing phasedown provisions. It also makes conforming edits such as striking certain clauses, revising cost recovery by removing an energy property subclause under section 168, and updating definitions to cover oil furnaces and boilers meeting 2021 Energy Star criteria and rated for at least 20 percent eligible fuel blends.

#### Page 182

Amendments referenced on this page apply to property whose construction begins after December 31, 2024, and Section 45U is amended to deny the zero-emission nuclear power production credit to specified foreign entities for taxable years beginning after enactment and to foreign-influenced entities beginning two years after enactment, with these changes applying to taxable years beginning after enactment. The clean hydrogen production credit’s cutoff moves from January 1, 2033 to January 1, 2028, and Section 45Y is modified to set 2032 as the applicable year and to bar credits for wind and solar facilities placed in service after December 31, 2027.

#### Page 183

Section 45Y is amended to exclude from qualified facility status any facility beginning construction after December 31, 2025 that includes material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity, and to deny the credit for any taxable year if the taxpayer is a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity, with an additional effective control rule tied to section 7701(a)(51)(D)(i)(II) for qualified facilities under subsection (b)(1). Section 7701(a) adds definitions stating that a prohibited foreign entity means a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity, establishes determination timing (last day of the taxable year, with a first-day rule for the initial taxable year), and defines specified foreign entity to include certain foreign entities of concern under 15 U.S.C. 4651 and entities identified as Chinese military companies operating in the United States.

#### Page 184

The law identifies covered entities—including those on specified federal lists, those designated under NDAA FY2024 section 154(b), and foreign-controlled entities—and defines a foreign-controlled entity as a covered nation’s government or its agency, certain nationals (excluding U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents), entities organized or based in a covered nation, or entities controlled by any of these. A foreign-influenced entity is one where a specified foreign entity can appoint a covered officer, owns at least 25 percent (or 40 percent in aggregate), holds at least 15 percent of its debt, or where the entity made a payment in the prior taxable year that entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise effective control over any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer or a related person.

#### Page 185

The text specifies that for eligible components produced by a taxpayer or related persons, including extraction, processing, or recycling of applicable critical minerals or the production of non-mineral eligible components, "effective control" means agreements giving counterparties specific authority over key aspects of production, energy generation in a qualified facility, or energy storage beyond authority, ownership, or debt. It requires the Secretary to issue guidance to prevent evasion of these restrictions and, prior to such guidance, defines "effective control" as a counterparty’s unrestricted contractual rights to determine production quantity or timing, govern electricity generation or energy storage activities, decide who may purchase or use outputs of production units or qualified facilities, and restrict access to data critical to energy production or storage.

#### Page 186

The text defines “effective control” in licensing or related agreements for intellectual property involving qualified facilities, energy storage technologies, or eligible component production, including when a counterparty can dictate sources of components or critical minerals, direct operations, limit the taxpayer’s use of IP, receive royalties beyond year ten, require service agreements longer than two years, or withhold necessary technical data and know-how. It also references control-indicating arrangements such as granting the counterparty’s personnel access to production sites and exclusive rights to maintain, repair, or operate essential equipment for producing eligible components or electricity.

#### Page 187

The text sets restrictions on impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, applies to contracts entered into or modified on or after enactment, extends the term “taxpayer” to related persons, defines “contractual counterparty,” and provides an exception for bona fide purchases or sales of intellectual property that does not include agreements with reversionary ownership. It requires the Secretary to issue guidance by December 31, 2026 to prevent evasion (including via temporary IP transfers or retained reversionary interests) and states that certain foreign-controlled entity rules do not apply to publicly traded entities whose securities are regularly traded on SEC-registered exchanges, the national market system, or other markets designated under section 1296 guidance.

#### Page 188

It establishes exceptions and clarifications to the foreign influenced entity rules, including nonapplication for entities with regularly traded securities or those at least 80 percent owned by such entities, and it excludes exchanges or markets incorporated in, or with a principal place of business in, covered nations from the applicable regular trading provision. It also sets additional criteria under which publicly traded companies are deemed foreign controlled or foreign influenced, based on control or ownership by specified foreign entities that must report beneficial ownership under Rule 13d-3 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 or an equivalent rule, such as when a foreign entity can appoint a covered officer or holds at least 25 percent of the company.

#### Page 189

This page sets thresholds for foreign involvement—aggregate ownership of at least 40 percent or original-issuance debt exceeding 15 percent of publicly traded debt to specified foreign entities—and defines covered officer roles. It also defines control as more than 50 percent ownership (by vote/value, profits/capital, or beneficial interests), applies ownership attribution under section 318(a)(2), and cross-references statutory meanings for applicable critical mineral, covered nation, eligible component, energy storage technology, qualified facility under sections 45Y(b)(1) and 48E(b)(3), and related under sections 267(b) and 707(b).

#### Page 190

The statute defines the beginning of construction by reference to IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as of January 1, 2025) and authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations and guidance, including anti-circumvention rules related to prohibited foreign entities. It defines “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” as a material assistance cost ratio below specified thresholds that rise over time—40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, and 60% for qualified facilities beginning construction in 2026 through after 2029; 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, and 75% for energy storage technology over the same periods; and 50% and 60% for solar energy components sold in 2026 and 2027.

#### Page 191

The provision sets escalating threshold percentages by calendar year for sales of specified components, including wind energy components (85% in 2026 and 90% in 2027), inverters (50% in 2026 rising to 70% after 2029), qualifying battery components (60% in 2026 rising to 85% after 2029), applicable critical minerals (0% before 2030 rising to 50% after 2032), and another category reaching 85% after 2029. It also requires the Secretary, by December 31, 2027, to issue adjusted threshold percentages for each applicable critical mineral that will replace the default schedule for each calendar year.

#### Page 192

It requires applicable critical mineral thresholds to equal or exceed otherwise applicable percentages, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns. It defines the material assistance cost ratio for qualified facilities, energy storage technology, and eligible components as the share of total direct (material) costs not attributable to prohibited foreign entities, and directs the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables and related guidance by December 31, 2026.

#### Page 193

The Secretary will issue safe harbor tables to determine the percentage of total direct costs of manufactured products and direct material costs of eligible components attributable to prohibited foreign entities, and to set rules for calculating a taxpayer’s material assistance from such entities. Before issuance and for construction beginning within 60 days after issuance, taxpayers may use IRS Notice 2025-08 tables and supplier certifications, but if they know or should know a product/component was produced by a prohibited foreign entity or a certification is inaccurate they must treat all relevant costs as attributable and may not rely on such certifications, with certification requirements aligning with Treasury Regulation §1.45X-4(c)(4)(i).

#### Page 194

The page sets supplier certification requirements: it must include the supplier’s employer identification number or a comparable foreign ID, be signed under penalties of perjury, be retained by both the supplier and the taxpayer for at least 6 years for the Secretary upon request, and, from the supplier of the purchased product/components, attest that the property was not produced by a prohibited foreign entity and disclose either (for section 45X) the total direct material costs per component not so produced or (for sections 45Y or 48E) the total direct costs attributable to manufactured products not so produced. It further allows, at the taxpayer’s election, exclusion from the material assistance cost ratio of costs for products, eligible components, or constituent elements/materials/subcomponents acquired or manufactured under a binding written contract entered before June 16, 2025 if they are placed in service before January 1, 2030 (or, for an applicable section 45Y facility, before January 1, 2028) in a facility whose construction began before August 1, 2025, or, in the case of constituent elements/materials/subcomponents, used in a product sold before January 1, 2030.

#### Page 195

The Secretary is directed to issue anti-circumvention regulations to prevent abuse of exceptions through stockpiling of manufactured products, eligible components, or their elements before requirements apply, and to deter evasion where construction has not genuinely begun. The page defines eligible component, energy storage technology, manufactured product, and qualified facility by reference to sections 45X, 45Y, and 48E, applies ownership and beginning-of-construction rules similar to paragraph (51)(H) and (J), and authorizes the Secretary to issue further regulations and guidance to implement these provisions.

#### Page 196

The text directs identification of components or products and rules for facilities producing multiple eligible components; denies the section 45Y credit for electricity produced with property described in section 25D(d)(1) or (4) when the taxpayer leases such property to a third party during the taxable year; and requires the Secretary, in setting emissions rate tables under section 45Y, to consider pre-enactment studies showing net lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rates not greater than zero using widely accepted lifecycle assessment concepts. It also amends section 45(b)(11) to expand qualifying areas for advanced nuclear facilities to include metropolitan statistical areas that, at any time after December 31, 2009, had at least 0.17 percent direct employment related to advancing nuclear power, including advanced nuclear facilities, related R&D, nuclear fuel cycle activities (mining, enrichment, manufacture, storage, disposal, recycling), and manufacturing or assembly of components used in advanced nuclear facilities.

#### Page 197

The page defines advanced nuclear facility by referencing section 45J(d)(2) and, via a special rule, deems reactor designs approved when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has authorized construction with a site-specific construction permit or combined license; it also amends Section 48E(a)(3)(A)(i) to apply section 45(b)(11)(B) without regard to clause (iv) and conforms Section 45Y(b)(1) by redesignating subparagraph (D) as (E) and inserting a new subparagraph (D) that allows capacity additions to be determined through regulatory determinations, independent engineering reports, regional transmission organization or independent system operator reports, or other methods provided by the Secretary. Further, Section 6418(g) is amended to prohibit transferring certain eligible credits to specified foreign entities, and Section 6501 is amended to extend the limitations period by redesignating subsection (o) as (p) and inserting a new subsection (o) addressing deficiencies attributable to errors in determining material assistance from prohibited foreign entities.

#### Page 198

The page extends the assessment period to six years for deficiencies tied to determinations under section 7701(a)(52) and amends section 6662 to address substantial understatements from disallowance of applicable energy credits (sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E) due to overstating the material assistance cost ratio by substituting 1 percent for 10 percent in subsection (d)(1)(A) and (B) and disregarding subparagraph (C). It also makes a conforming change to section 6417(d)(6) to apply subparagraph (A) to excessive payments from such disallowances and creates section 6695B imposing penalties on suppliers who provide certifications used under section 7701(a)(52) that they know or should know are false regarding prohibited foreign entities or cost figures.

#### Page 199

Establishes IRC section 6695B imposing a penalty on persons who make substantial misstatements on supplier certifications about prohibited foreign entities that result in disallowance of an applicable energy credit and an understatement exceeding the lesser of 5% of tax required or $100,000, with the penalty equal to the greater of 10% of the attributable underpayment or $5,000, subject to a reasonable-cause (not willful neglect) exception and definitions tied to section 7701(a)(52). Clerical amendments add 6695B throughout section 6696, create a 6-year period for assessment and refund claims of 6695B penalties, update the table of sections, and set effective dates generally for taxable years beginning after enactment and, for amendments concerning material assistance from prohibited foreign entities, for facilities beginning construction after December 31, 2025.

#### Page 200

Penalties for substantial misstatements on supplier certifications apply to certifications provided after December 31, 2025, and termination provisions for wind and solar facilities apply to projects whose construction begins 12 months after the Act’s enactment. Section 70513 amends section 48E to end the clean electricity investment credit for qualified property at wind and solar facilities placed in service after December 31, 2027 (with an exception for energy storage technology at such facilities), and to exclude from eligibility any facility, interconnection property, or energy storage technology whose construction begins after December 31, 2025 if it includes material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

#### Page 201

The text amends section 48E to deny the clean electricity investment credit to specified foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities, to bar the credit when effective control under section 7701(a)(51)(D)(i)(II) applies to certain qualified facilities or energy storage technologies, and to disqualify property whose construction includes material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity. It also amends section 50(a) to add a 10-year recapture rule imposing a tax increase equal to 100 percent of prior-year credit amounts if a specified taxpayer (one allowed a section 48E credit for a taxable year beginning after two years from enactment) makes an applicable payment as defined in section 7701(a)(51)(D)(i)(II), and updates the recapture paragraph to include such payments.

#### Page 202

Amendments deny the section 48E credit for qualified investments in wind or solar property described in section 25D(d)(1) or (4) when such property is leased to third parties during the taxable year and add a section 50 rule that ownership of geothermal heat pump energy property is determined without regard to whether it is readily usable by someone other than the lessee or service recipient. The page also revises domestic content requirements for section 48E with adjusted percentage thresholds of 40% (20% offshore) before June 16, 2025, 45% (27.5% offshore) from June 16 to December 31, 2025, and 50% (35% offshore) during 2026, and makes conforming cross-reference edits to sections 1371(d)(1), 6418(g)(3), and a redesignated paragraph to include reference to paragraph (4).

#### Page 203

The law revises energy credits by reducing the energy percentage for certain energy property under section 48(a)(2)(A)(ii) to 0 percent with no increases, applying the clean electricity investment credit to qualified fuel cell property at a fixed 30 percent with specified exclusions, and setting 55 percent for qualified investments in facilities or energy storage beginning construction after December 31, 2026. Effective dates include general applicability to taxable years after enactment, domestic content rules from June 16, 2025, elimination of the energy credit for property starting construction on or after June 16, 2025, fuel cell provisions for property starting construction after December 31, 2025, termination for wind and solar facilities 12 months after enactment, and the start of phase-out and restrictions on the advanced manufacturing production credit by amending section 45X(d)(4) on sales of integrated components.

#### Page 204

A sale to an unrelated person is deemed to occur when a primary eligible component is integrated into a secondary eligible component produced in the same facility and the secondary component is sold to an unrelated person, provided at least 65% of the secondary component’s total direct material costs are attributable to primary components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. The law amends section 45X(b)(3) to add termination language and phases out the credit for applicable critical minerals (excluding metallurgical coal) produced after December 31, 2030 to 75% in 2031, 50% in 2032, 25% in 2033, and 0% thereafter.

#### Page 205

The page sets termination dates for credit eligibility for wind energy components after December 31, 2027 and metallurgical coal after December 31, 2029, and adds metallurgical coal as an applicable critical mineral for the advanced manufacturing production credit. It tightens Section 45X by excluding components with material assistance from prohibited foreign entities and denying credits to specified foreign or foreign-influenced entities, while expanding the battery module definition to include other essential equipment such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses.

#### Page 206

The law incorporates DOE’s designation of metallurgical coal used for steelmaking as a critical material regardless of production location, sets its Section 45X credit at 2.5 percent, applies most amendments to taxable years after enactment with the integrated components sale change starting for components sold in taxable years after December 31, 2026, and bars increases to the Section 48C advanced energy project credit allocation effective upon enactment. It modifies the Clean Fuel Production Credit to require feedstocks from the United States, Mexico, or Canada, allows rounding of emissions rates to the nearest 5 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU, and prohibits negative emissions rates, all effective for transportation fuel produced and emissions rates published after December 31, 2025.

#### Page 207

Section 45Z(b)(1)(B) is amended to exclude emissions from indirect land use change and to provide distinct, potentially negative emissions rates for fuels derived from specified animal manures, with conforming changes and applicability to transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025. The law extends the clean fuel production credit to December 31, 2029, adds anti-double-credit rules and related guidance, permits additional related-person rules for sales to unrelated persons, and begins coordinating credits for sustainable aviation fuel by adding a new paragraph to Section 6426(k).

#### Page 208

Sets applicability for certain fuel credits to fuel sold or used on or after enactment (and to unpaid pre-enactment claims under section 6426(k)), eliminates a special rate, and revises the definition of sustainable aviation fuel as liquid fuel (the portion of which is not kerosene) sold for use in aircraft that meets ASTM D7566 or the Fischer Tropsch provisions of ASTM D1655 Annex A1 and is not derived from palm fatty acid distillates or petroleum, effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025. It terminates the section 6426(k) sustainable aviation fuel credit after September 30, 2025, amends producer registration references to section 40B effective for transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2024, and extends and modifies the small agri-biodiesel producer credit by increasing the rate to 20 cents and adding compliance with section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(iii).

#### Page 209

The law updates biodiesel fuel incentives by allowing the small agri-biodiesel producer credit to be used for sales or uses after December 31, 2026, clarifying it can be combined with the section 45Z clean fuel production credit, permitting transfer of that small producer credit under section 6418, and applying these changes to fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025. It also restricts eligibility for the section 45Z and section 45Q credits for prohibited foreign entities—disallowing credits for specified foreign entities for taxable years beginning after enactment and, for section 45Z, for foreign-influenced entities beginning two years after enactment (with the section 45Q ban covering both immediately)—and amends section 45Q to address parity for different uses of qualified carbon oxide.

#### Page 210

The law revises section 45Q by redefining eligible carbon oxide disposition and use (secure geological storage; tertiary injectant in qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery with secure storage; or utilization under subsection (f)(5)), striking paragraph (4), and setting the applicable credit to $17 (or $36 in specified cases) with an inflation adjustment after 2026, while updating related cross-references. The amendments take effect so that prohibited foreign entity restrictions apply to taxable years beginning after enactment, and the parity changes for different uses and utilizations apply to facilities or equipment placed in service after enactment.

#### Page 211

Section 70523 amends Section 56A(c)(13) to reduce adjusted financial statement income by tax depreciation under section 167 for section 168 property and by deductions under section 263(c) (including sections 59(e) and 291(b)(2)) for intangible drilling and development costs, and to disregard applicable financial statement depreciation and depletion expenses for such property and costs, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Section 70524 amends Section 7704(d)(1)(E) to expand qualifying income for certain publicly traded partnerships to include income and gains from exploration, transportation or storage of specified fuels (including section 6426 fuels, alcohol fuel, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel) and liquified or compressed hydrogen, and income related to qualified carbon oxide production under section 45Q, adding income from hydrogen storage, carbon capture, advanced nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy to qualifying income.

#### Page 212

The amendments expand qualifying activities to include electric power generation, storage, carbon dioxide capture, electricity from advanced nuclear facilities, energy produced exclusively from certain qualified resources, and operation of specified energy property, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Section 70525 adds IRC §6435 to pay eligible persons the previously paid §4081 tax on indelibly dyed diesel fuel or kerosene that is exempt under §4082(a) when removed from a terminal, references a civil penalty for excessive claims, and makes conforming changes to §§6206 and 6430.

#### Page 213

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add Section 6435 on dyed fuel, updating Section 6675 references and the table of sections, with these changes applying to eligible indelibly dyed diesel fuel or kerosene removed 180 days after enactment. Modifies the de minimis entry privilege by imposing civil penalties of up to $5,000 for a first violation and $10,000 for subsequent violations effective 30 days after enactment and, effective July 1, 2027, repealing the commercial shipment exception and the added subsection, and makes permanent the limitation on excess business losses of noncorporate taxpayers while adjusting amounts used to calculate such losses.

#### Page 214

Certain date references are updated by extending them to December 31, 2025 and 2024, with subsection (a) applying to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026 and subsection (b) (adjusting amounts for calculating excess business losses) applying to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Section 70602 prospectively amends section 707(a)(2) regarding partnership payments and preserves prior treatment for pre-enactment transactions, and Section 70603 adds aggregation rules to section 162(m) so publicly held corporations in a controlled group must apply the $1,000,000 deduction limit across the group using an allocable limitation amount proportional to each member’s compensation paid to specified covered employees.

#### Page 215

The page amends the tax code to aggregate applicable employee remuneration across all members of a controlled group for specified covered employees of publicly held corporations, defines those terms, and makes the change effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. It also establishes a 1 percent excise tax on remittance transfers funded with cash or similar physical instruments, requiring the sender to pay and the remittance transfer provider to collect and remit the tax quarterly to the Secretary (with secondary liability if unpaid), while excluding certain noncash-funded transfers.

#### Page 216

The page defines remittance transfer terms by reference to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, extends coverage to transfers handled by entities described in 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(2)(A)-(H) and subject to subchapter II of chapter 53 or funded by U.S.-issued debit or credit cards, applies anti-conduit rules by treating multiple-party remittance arrangements as financing transactions, adds Subchapter C - Remittance Transfers to chapter 36, and sets an effective date for transfers after December 31, 2025. It also establishes a $1,000 assessable penalty per failure for COVID-ERTC promoters that do not meet due diligence requirements similar to section 6695(g), limits the penalty to documents used in connection with returns or refund claims, and treats the penalty as imposed under section 6695(g) and assessed under section 6201.

#### Page 217

Secretary means the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary’s delegate, and a COVID-ERTC promoter is any person who provides paid aid, assistance, or advice regarding a COVID-ERTC document and meets specified gross receipt thresholds, including charging fees based on the amount of the credit or refund and surpassing 20% or 50% revenue tests or a combined over-20% and over-$500,000 test. The term excludes certified professional employer organizations, applies aggregation rules treating related entities as one, addresses short taxable years by using either the actual year or the calendar year start, and defines a COVID-ERTC document as any filing related to any credit or advance payment under section 3134, including materials on eligibility, calculation, or determination of amounts.

#### Page 218

Refunds or allowances of the Employee Retention Credit are barred after enactment unless the claim was filed by January 31, 2024, and the assessment period is extended to six years from the latest of the original filing date, the deemed filing date, or the claim date, with the refund period for deductions related to improperly claimed ERTC wages aligned to that window and such wages defined. The law broadens the erroneous refund penalty to include income or employment tax, establishes effective dates for each provision after enactment, and directs the Secretary to issue necessary regulations or guidance.

#### Page 219

Section 70606 amends section 25A(g)(1) to require that tax returns claiming the American Opportunity or Lifetime Learning credits include the taxpayer’s social security number, the name and SSN of any non-spouse student for whom expenses are claimed, and (for the American Opportunity Tax Credit) the employer identification number of institutions paid, defines “social security number” by reference to section 24(h)(7), treats omissions as mathematical or clerical errors by replacing “TIN” with “social security number or employer identification number” in section 6213(g)(2)(J), and applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2025. Section 70607 appropriates $15,000,000 for FY 2026 for Treasury to deliver within 90 days a report to Congress on costs and feasibility of replacing IRS direct e-file with enhanced public-private free filing partnerships, taxpayer preferences between government-run and private services, how to standardize and simplify options and features across providers, and the costs of developing and administering a free direct e-file system including differential coverage by AGI and return complexity.

#### Page 220

Section 71101 imposes a moratorium from enactment through September 30, 2034 on the Secretary of Health and Human Services implementing, administering, or enforcing specified amendments in the September 21, 2023 CMS final rule on streamlining Medicare Savings Program eligibility and enrollment (affecting 42 CFR 406.21(c), 435.4, 435.601, 435.911, and 435.952), and appropriates $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 to the CMS Administrator to carry out Sections 71101 and 71102. Section 71102 likewise bars, for the same period, implementation, administration, or enforcement of specified amendments from the April 2, 2024 CMS final rule on streamlining Medicaid, CHIP, and Basic Health Program application, eligibility, enrollment, and renewal processes, affecting 42 CFR 431.213(d) and Part 435 sections 435.222, 435.407, 435.907, 435.911(c), 435.912, 435.916, 435.919, and 435.1200(b)(3)(i)-(v), (e)(1)(ii), and (h)(1).

#### Page 221

Section 71103 amends Social Security Act §1902 to require that by January 1, 2027, states and D.C. regularly obtain address information for Medicaid enrollees and, by October 1, 2029, submit monthly and per-(re)determination enrollee data (including SSNs when required and other Secretary-determined information) to a federal system to prevent multi-state simultaneous enrollment. States must use this system to detect and address duplicate enrollment by verifying residency and disenrolling nonresidents subject to Secretary-specified exceptions, and the text also references related sections in parts 447 and 457.

#### Page 222

By October 1, 2029, the Secretary must establish a system for the Secretary and States to prevent simultaneous enrollment under multiple State plans or waivers, provide monthly cross-state enrollment checks, and set privacy-protective standards, with appropriations to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of $10,000,000 in FY2026 to establish and $20,000,000 in FY2029 to maintain. States must regularly obtain and act on enrollee address updates using reliable sources including USPS returned mail with forwarding addresses, the USPS National Change of Address database, address information from contracted managed care or prepaid plans verified with the individual, and other Secretary-approved sources, and conforming amendments to PARIS are made.

#### Page 223

The law revises Medicaid address verification and data-matching by providing that, beginning October 1, 2029, checks may be conducted through a new system under section 1902(uu) and allowing the Secretary to determine that States need not use the prior public data-matching system for address verification under section 1902(vv). It also requires, effective January 1, 2027, managed care and prepaid plans to promptly transmit enrollee address information to States, aligns CHIP with these address and managed care provisions, and adds a new requirement that States comply with eligibility verification under subsection (ww) to prevent deceased individuals from remaining enrolled.

#### Page 224

The law adds a new Medicaid eligibility verification subsection effective January 1, 2027 requiring states to conduct at least quarterly checks of the Death Master File (or successor) to identify deceased enrollees, disenroll them and stop payments, with immediate retroactive reinstatement if misidentification occurs. It also clarifies that states may use other electronic data sources while complying with these requirements, and amends section 1902(kk)(1) to require provider enrollment screening against the Death Master File beginning January 1, 2028.

#### Page 225

Section 71106 amends SSA §1903(u)(1) to allow audit findings by the Secretary or, at the Secretary’s option, by States; caps waiver amounts to the portion of erroneous excess Medicaid payments exceeding the 0.03 allowable error rate; replaces gendered references with “the Secretary”; and expands errors to include payments with insufficient eligibility information and payments for ineligible individuals, effective beginning fiscal year 2030. It also requires States to check the Death Master File at least quarterly to identify deceased enrolled providers or suppliers and, starting the first quarter after December 31, 2026, to conduct semiannual redeterminations of Medicaid eligibility for certain individuals, subject to clause (ii).

#### Page 226

Requirements are established for individuals described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) and certain waiver enrollees to receive coverage equivalent to minimum essential coverage, with an exemption for a specified category, a definition of State as the 50 States and DC, and directives for HHS/CMS to issue guidance within 180 days with $75,000,000 appropriated for fiscal year 2026. Section 71108 revises the home equity limit for Medicaid long-term care by amending §1917(f)(1) to adjust the dollar amount and treatment for homes on agricultural-zoned lots, allow States to elect a higher limit for non-agricultural homes up to $1,000,000 without regard to statewideness and comparability, and modify subparagraph (C) to exclude that amount and add a new sentence.

#### Page 227

It clarifies that the Medicaid home equity interest limit under section 1917(f) must be applied when determining eligibility for nursing facility and other long-term care services, including by deeming equity in certain agricultural homes above $1,000,000 to be $1,000,000, with the subsection (a) change effective January 1, 2028. It also amends Medicaid alien eligibility to bar federal payment beginning October 1, 2026 (subject to existing exceptions in paragraphs (2) and (4)) unless the individual is a resident of a State, DC, or a U.S. territory and is a U.S. citizen/national, lawful permanent resident, Cuban or Haitian entrant, or a Compact of Free Association resident, and makes a conforming amendment to CHIP.

#### Page 228

The law redesignates certain subparagraphs and inserts a new paragraph (R) referencing Social Security Act §1903(v)(5) on payments for medical assistance to aliens (excluding services under §2105(a)(1)(D)(ii)), and appropriates $15,000,000 in FY2026 to CMS for implementation. It adds §1905(kk) to cap, starting October 1, 2026, the FMAP for emergency medical condition services to aliens at the State’s regular FMAP with $1,000,000 for implementation, imposes a moratorium through September 30, 2034 on CMS’s 2024 minimum staffing rule for long-term care facilities (42 CFR 483.5 and 483.35), and amends §1902(a)(34) to reduce State Medicaid costs.

#### Page 229

The law limits Medicaid retroactive eligibility to the month before the application month for individuals described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) and to the second month before the application month for others (with a conforming change to the definition of “medical assistance”), and amends CHIP to bar States from providing retroactive child health or pregnancy-related assistance for items and services furnished before the second month preceding the application month. These changes apply to assistance based on applications filed on or after the first day of the first quarter beginning after December 31, 2026, and appropriate funding for implementation.

#### Page 230

Provides $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to remain available until expended. For the 1-year period beginning on enactment, federal direct spending under Medicaid state plans or waivers may not be used, whether paid directly or via contracts with covered organizations, to entities (including affiliates) that are 501(c)(3) essential community providers primarily engaged in family planning and reproductive health that provide abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment and that received over $800,000 in combined federal and state Medicaid expenditures in FY2023, with definitions provided for direct spending and covered organization.

#### Page 231

It defines “State” by reference to the Social Security Act and appropriates $1,000,000 to CMS for fiscal year 2026 to implement the section. It then begins Subchapter C on stopping abusive financing practices by amending Medicaid to sunset the increased FMAP incentive unless states begin spending for all such individuals before January 1, 2026, and by revising provider tax hold-harmless thresholds for fiscal years starting on or after October 1, 2026 to replace the 6 percent cap with an “applicable percent” that, for non-expansion states, preserves the determined percent for existing qualifying taxes or sets it at 0 percent if none exists.

#### Page 232

The statute sets phased caps on the percentage of net patient revenue that expansion States may raise through taxes on specified health care provider classes—5.5% in FY2028, 5% in FY2029, 4.5% in FY2030, 4% in FY2031, and 3.5% in FY2032 and beyond—with 0% if no such tax existed at enactment, generally applying the lower of a Secretary-determined rate or these caps. It defines “expansion State” and “non-expansion State,” allows qualifying existing expansion-State taxes within the hold-harmless threshold to use the Secretary-determined percentage instead of the scheduled cap, limits applicability to the 50 States and D.C., and appropriates $20,000,000 in FY2026 to CMS for implementation.

#### Page 233

The Secretary must revise 42 CFR 438.6(c)(2)(iii) to cap state-directed payments for services furnished in rating periods beginning on or after enactment at 100% of the specified total published Medicare rate (or the Medicaid plan/waiver rate if no Medicare rate) for states that provide minimum essential coverage to all individuals in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII), and at 110% for other states, with newly expanding states subject to the 100% cap for services furnished in rating periods beginning on or after enactment. Payments with written prior approval (or good-faith efforts) before May 1, 2025, rural hospital payments for the rating period occurring within 180 days of enactment approved by that date, or payments for such rating period with a completed preprint submitted before enactment are grandfathered and, starting with the rating period on or after January 1, 2028, must be reduced by 10 percentage points annually until they meet the new limits; “rating period” has the meaning in 42 CFR 438.2.

#### Page 234

The page defines “rural hospital” to include specified hospital categories (subsection (d) hospitals in rural areas or rural census tracts, critical access, sole community, Medicare-dependent small rural, low-volume, and rural emergency hospitals), sets definitions for “State,” “total published Medicare payment rate,” and “written prior approval,” and appropriates $7,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2026 through 2033 to carry out the section. It also amends Medicaid provider tax rules by adding a clause to section 1903(w) that a tax is not deemed generally redistributive when, within a permissible class, tax rates for taxpayers or groups with relatively lower volumes or percentages of Medicaid taxable units are lower than the rates for those with relatively higher volumes or percentages.

#### Page 235

Clarifies that within a permissible class of health care-related taxes, imposing higher rates on taxpayers based on Medicaid taxable units than on those based on non-Medicaid taxable units, or using descriptions that approximate Medicaid groups to exclude or impose lower rates, has the same effect as the specified subclauses, and defines Medicaid taxable unit, non-Medicaid taxable unit, and tax rate group. Specifies that these amendments apply only to the 50 States and the District of Columbia and take effect upon enactment, with a Secretary-determined transition period not exceeding three fiscal years.

#### Page 236

Beginning January 1, 2027, Medicaid section 1115 demonstration projects, renewals, and amendments must be certified by the CMS Chief Actuary as budget neutral relative to baseline expenditures (including services and populations a state could otherwise cover, even at different sites of service), and the Secretary must specify how any savings are accounted for in subsequent approval periods. The law appropriates $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027 to CMS for implementation and initiates a new requirement for states to establish Medicaid community engagement requirements for certain individuals by the first quarter after December 31, 2026 or earlier under a waiver or state plan.

#### Page 237

A State must require applicable individuals to demonstrate community engagement either for 1 to 3 consecutive months immediately before applying for medical assistance or for specified months between their most recent and next eligibility redeterminations or, if the State conducts more frequent checks, between verifications. An individual satisfies monthly compliance by working, performing community service, participating in a work program, enrolling at least half-time in an educational program, combining these activities to reach at least 80 hours, or meeting minimum wage-based income thresholds (including for seasonal workers), subject to exceptions and criteria set by the Secretary through regulation.

#### Page 238

A State plan (or waiver) may deem an individual to have met community engagement for a month, and may elect not to require verification, if the individual is a specified excluded individual, is under age 19, is entitled to or enrolled in Medicare Part A or B, is described in any of subclauses (I) through (VII) of subsection (a)(10)(A)(i), or was an inmate of a public institution at any time during the 3 months ending on the first day of that month. The plan may also provide an optional exception for short-term hardship events under State procedures meeting Secretary standards, deeming compliance automatically for individuals residing in a county with a presidentially declared emergency or disaster or, subject to a State request to the Secretary, a high unemployment rate at or above the lesser of 8 percent or another specified threshold, and upon the individual’s request for those receiving inpatient or similar high-acuity services (including related outpatient care) or other specified events.

#### Page 239

It establishes criteria under which an applicable individual may be deemed to have met community engagement requirements, including residing in an area with unemployment at least 1.5 times the national rate or needing extended travel outside their community to obtain necessary treatment for serious or complex medical conditions unavailable locally. States must verify compliance at each regularly scheduled eligibility redetermination (with the option to verify more often) using ex parte processes and reliable data per the Secretary’s standards (such as payroll and encounter data), and if verification fails, issue a notice of noncompliance and allow 30 days from receipt for the individual to show compliance or that the requirement does not apply.

#### Page 240

States must send written notice to applicable individuals who fail community engagement requirements explaining how to show compliance or exemption and how to reapply, continue coverage for 30 days while the individual may make a satisfactory showing, and if none is made and the person is not otherwise excluded, deny or disenroll by the end of the month after the month in which that 30-day period ends, after first checking for other eligibility and offering a fair hearing. States are not penalized on federal matching or expansion coverage metrics solely for ineligibility due to such failures, and individuals are deemed to have minimum essential coverage for a month for premium tax credit purposes if they would have qualified for Medicaid but for failing the community engagement requirement.

#### Page 241

States must, beginning a set number of months before December 31, 2026 (or an earlier State-selected date) and periodically thereafter, notify applicable individuals under a State plan or waiver about the community engagement requirement, including how to comply, exceptions, consequences of noncompliance, and how to report status changes that could trigger an exception or qualification as a specified excluded individual. Notices must be delivered by regular mail (or electronically if elected) plus at least one additional method such as phone, text, website, or other common electronic means, and an “applicable individual” is a non-excluded person eligible or enrolled under the State plan’s expansion group or under a waiver providing coverage equivalent to minimum essential coverage who is 19 to 64 years old, not pregnant, and not entitled to or enrolled in Medicare Part A.

#### Page 242

The text defines a "specified excluded individual"—to be determined by the State in accordance with standards set by the Secretary—for purposes of clause (i). Qualifying categories include certain Medicaid-eligible persons; Indians, Urban Indians, California Indians, or others eligible for Indian Health Service; parents, guardians, caretaker relatives, or family caregivers of a dependent child age 13 or under or a disabled individual; veterans rated totally disabled; medically frail individuals or those with special medical needs (including blindness/disability, substance use disorder, disabling mental disorder, significant physical/intellectual/developmental disability affecting activities of daily living, or a serious/complex medical condition); persons complying with State requirements under section 407 or members of SNAP households subject to work requirements; participants in drug or alcohol treatment programs; and inmates of public institutions.

#### Page 243

It defines individuals who are pregnant or entitled to postpartum medical assistance, clarifies what constitutes an educational program, a State, and a work program, and prohibits waiver of community engagement requirements. A special implementation rule permits the Secretary to grant exemptions to States demonstrating good-faith efforts—considering actions taken, significant barriers, detailed plans with milestones, and other appropriate criteria—with exemptions expiring no later than December 31, 2028 and subject to early termination for failure to meet reporting requirements.

#### Page 244

States granted exemptions must submit quarterly progress reports on milestones toward full compliance and information on risks, barriers, or challenges with mitigation plans; a conforming amendment adds subsection (xx), and States are barred from using contractors with financial ties to Medicaid managed care entities to determine beneficiary compliance. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue an interim final rule by June 1, 2026 without notice-and-comment and provide Government Efficiency grants—funded by new appropriations and allocated partly in proportion to each State’s number of applicable individuals as of March 31, 2025 and partly in equal shares—to help States build eligibility determination systems.

#### Page 245

The law appropriates $100,000,000 each in FY2026 for two sets of grants and $200,000,000 in FY2026 to the CMS Administrator for implementation, with funds available until expended, and defines “State” to include the 50 States and the District of Columbia. It amends SSA §1916 to, beginning October 1, 2028, prohibit premiums for specified Medicaid expansion individuals while requiring States to impose cost sharing greater than $0 on certain services, with limits that exclude primary care, mental health, substance use disorder services, and services from FQHCs, certified community behavioral health clinics, and rural health clinics.

#### Page 246

Establishes cost-sharing limits for specified individuals, including a per-service cap of $35, prescription drug charges capped at levels referenced in section 1916A(c)(2)(A)(i) or (2)(B), and a family aggregate cap of 5% of income applied monthly or quarterly, while allowing providers to require payment of authorized charges as a condition of service or reduce/waive them case by case. Defines specified individuals as those with income above the poverty line enrolled as Medicaid expansion adults or under equivalent minimum essential coverage waivers, defines State as a State or DC, and makes a conforming amendment to section 1902(a)(14) to require imposition of such charges in accordance with section 1916(k)(2).

#### Page 247

Nonapplicability of alternative cost sharing is updated by adding a reference to subsection (k) in section 1916A(a)(1) of the Social Security Act, and $15,000,000 is appropriated to the CMS Administrator for fiscal year 2026 to implement these provisions. Beginning July 1, 2028, a new section 1915(c)(11) allows the Secretary to approve standalone waivers to cover part or all of the cost of home or community-based services (excluding room and board) provided under a written plan of care as medical assistance under a State plan, with an initial 3-year term and 5-year extensions, subject to State conditions including that other waivers are compliant and that approval will not materially increase wait times for individuals with a determination described in paragraph (1), with certain existing requirements excepted or deemed inapplicable.

#### Page 248

States seeking approval to provide home- and community-based services (HCBS) to individuals without a paragraph (1) level-of-care determination must establish Secretary-approved needs-based eligibility criteria and specify covered services, while maintaining more stringent criteria for assessing institutional level of care. They must also attest to cost neutrality relative to institutional care and supply specified data to the Secretary—pre-approval counts of eligible individuals and, at least annually, service-level costs, durations, comparative analyses with institutional and paragraph (1) populations, and numbers served.

#### Page 249

States are barred from using program payments to provide third-party employee-type benefits for individual practitioners when the program is their primary revenue source, and $50,000,000 (FY2026) is appropriated for CMS implementation plus $100,000,000 (FY2027) for State support of HCBS delivery under sections 1915(c) and 1115, allocated proportionally to each State’s HCBS-receiving population. Title XVIII is amended to add section 1899C, limiting Medicare entitlement/enrollment to U.S. citizens or nationals, lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and certain Compact of Free Association residents, with application to current beneficiaries addressed in a subsequent subsection.

#### Page 250

Subsection (a) will apply starting 18 months after enactment for individuals already entitled to or enrolled for benefits, and within 1 year the Commissioner of Social Security must review such individuals to identify those not covered by subsection (a)(1)-(4) and promptly notify them that their benefits will terminate 18 months after enactment in a manner ensuring comprehension. The law extends the temporary Medicare Physician Fee Schedule increase to services furnished in 2026 with a 2.5 percent add-on and makes conforming 2026 references, and it amends Social Security Act §1192(e) to expand and clarify the orphan drug exclusion under the drug price negotiation program.

#### Page 251

Amendments update the treatment of orphan drugs by allowing designation for one or more rare diseases (as defined in section 526(a)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) and by adding rules for former orphan drugs so that price applicability dates run from the first day after orphan status ends, effective for initial price applicability years on or after January 1, 2028. It also revises section 36B to permit premium tax credits only for certain individuals by requiring that lawfully present aliens be eligible aliens, those reasonably expected to maintain status for the entire enrollment period, including lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and individuals lawfully residing in the United States under a Compact of Free Association.

#### Page 252

Conforming amendments to 42 U.S.C. 18081 and 18082 require verification and attestation that lawfully present individuals are “eligible aliens” as defined in IRC §36B(e)(2), and replace “alien lawfully present” with “eligible alien” in §5000A(d)(3). The changes take effect for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2027 (for subsection (c)) and for taxable years after December 31, 2026 (for other amendments), and SEC. 71302 disallows the premium tax credit during periods of Medicaid ineligibility due to alien status by striking §36B(c)(1)(B).

#### Page 253

The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, and require Exchanges to verify an individual's eligibility to enroll in a qualified health plan and to receive advance premium tax credit payments before a month can be treated as a coverage month. Applicable enrollment information to be affirmed includes household income, family size, eligible alien status, health coverage status, and residence (plus other Secretary-determined data), months before verification can count once eligibility is later verified, failure to meet these verification requirements does not by itself make someone ineligible to enroll, and the Secretary may waive verification during special enrollment periods based on family-size changes.

#### Page 254

The law amends 26 U.S.C. §36B to exclude any month from “coverage month” when an Exchange fails specified filing requirements and to require Exchanges, by August 1, to offer a pre-enrollment verification process for applicants to verify household income and eligibility for the subsequent plan year, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2027. It also disallows the premium tax credit for plans enrolled during special enrollment periods based solely on income thresholds rather than qualifying events (effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2025) and removes the limitation on recapturing advance premium tax credits by striking §36B(f)(2)(B).

#### Page 255

Conforming amendments revise the phrasing in sections 36B(f)(2) and 35(g)(12)(B)(ii), effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, and permanently extend the safe harbor so high deductible health plans may cover telehealth and other remote care services without a deductible starting with plan years after December 31, 2024. Bronze and catastrophic individual Exchange plans are deemed high deductible health plans for HSA eligibility for months after December 31, 2025, and direct primary care service arrangements are expressly not treated as health plans, with a definition introduced.

#### Page 256

A direct primary care service arrangement is defined as medical care consisting solely of primary care services furnished by primary care practitioners for a fixed periodic fee, excludes services requiring general anesthesia, prescription drugs other than vaccines, and laboratory services not typically administered in an ambulatory primary care setting, and is disqualified if monthly aggregate fees exceed $150 (or $300 if covering more than one individual). The law treats such fees as medical expenses under IRC section 223, adds an inflation adjustment for the dollar amount in subsection (c)(1)(E)(ii)(II) beginning for taxable years after 2026 with calendar year 2025 as the base, directs issuance of regulations or guidance, and applies the amendments to months after December 31, 2025.

#### Page 257

The law adds subsection (h) establishing the Rural Health Transformation Program and appropriates $10,000,000,000 each for fiscal years 2026–2030 to the CMS Administrator to allot to States for specified activities. It requires annual determinations and redistribution of unexpended or unobligated funds from 2028–2032, makes allotted funds available through the end of the following fiscal year (with redistributed funds similarly available, except those redistributed in FY 2032 only through September 30, 2032), mandates return of remaining funds to the Treasury by October 1, 2032, and permits the Administrator to withhold, reduce, or recover payments for misuse.

#### Page 258

Any amounts withheld, reduced, or recovered by the Administrator shall be returned to the U.S. Treasury. To receive a State allotment, an application submitted during a window ending no later than December 31, 2025 must include a comprehensive rural health transformation plan (covering access, outcomes, technology, partnerships, clinician supply, data-driven local care, financial solvency, and causes of rural hospital distress), a certification that funds will not finance the non-Federal share via intergovernmental transfers or certified public expenditures, any other required information, and the Administrator must approve or deny all applications by December 31, 2025.

#### Page 259

Upon approval of a one-time application, each of the 50 States—and only the 50 States—remains eligible for annual allotments for fiscal years 2026 through 2030, except as provided in paragraph (1)(B)(iv). The Administrator allocates each year’s appropriations by distributing 50 percent equally among approved States and 50 percent based on criteria that ensure at least one-quarter of approved States receive funds from that portion and consider rural population in metropolitan census tracts (per the Goldsmith Modification), the State’s share of rural health facilities, the hospital situation described in section 1902(a)(13)(A)(iv), other appropriate factors, and defines “rural health facility” to include subsection (d) hospitals located in rural areas.

#### Page 260

These provisions enumerate categories of rural or rural-designated providers and facilities—including critical access, sole community, Medicare-dependent small rural, low-volume, and rural emergency hospitals; rural health clinics; Federally qualified health centers; community mental health centers; section 330-funded health centers; and certain opioid treatment programs and certified community behavioral health clinics located in rural census tracts as defined by the Goldsmith Modification. They also state that States approved for an allotment need not provide matching funds and, under Administrator-specified terms and conditions, must submit a plan to use the allotment for at least three activities and annual reports on its use.

#### Page 261

States may spend no more than 10 percent of their annual allotments on administrative expenses and must use the funds for at least three activities, including evidence-based prevention and chronic disease management, payments to providers, consumer-facing technology, technology-enabled improvements (e.g., remote monitoring, robotics, AI) and workforce recruitment in rural hospitals, IT and cybersecurity upgrades, right-sizing rural systems, access to OUD/SUD and mental health services, innovative value-based models, and other Administrator-approved uses to sustain high-quality rural care. These payments are exempt from specified subsection (c) provisions, are not subject to administrative or judicial review regarding allotments, withholdings, or recoveries, define “health care provider” as an enrolled provider or supplier under this title, title XVIII, or title XIX, and note conforming amendments to Title XXI.

#### Page 262

It revises statutory language to create an exception for a rural health transformation program under section 2105(h), aligns related references to section 2105, directs the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to implement via program guidance, and appropriates $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2025 to carry out these changes. It also increases the public debt limit by $5,000,000,000,000 and prohibits the use of federal funds for unemployment benefits (and related administrative costs) to individuals whose base-period wages are at least $1,000,000, requiring applicant self-certification and state verification using available systems.

#### Page 263

State agencies administering any Federal unemployment compensation program must verify wage eligibility by assessing claimant income and require repayment of overpayments, the prohibition under paragraph (1) applies to weeks of unemployment beginning on or after enactment, and the term “unemployment compensation program of the United States” is defined to include benefits for Federal civilian employees and ex-servicemembers, extended benefits, any temporary extensions or weekly amount increases, and other programs determined by the Secretary of Labor. Section 480(f)(2) of the Higher Education Act is amended to exempt from the net value calculation a family farm on which the family resides, a family-owned and controlled small business with not more than 100 full-time or full-time equivalent employees (or any part of such a small business), and a family-owned commercial fishing business including vessels and permits, effective July 1, 2026.

#### Page 264

The law amends the Higher Education Act to confirm that graduate and professional students have been ineligible for subsidized Stafford loans for periods beginning on or after July 1, 2012, while allowing through June 30, 2026 an increased annual Unsubsidized Stafford amount equal to the standard limit plus the former subsidized amount. Effective July 1, 2026, Graduate/Professional PLUS loans are terminated for such students and new annual Unsubsidized Stafford limits apply—$20,500 for graduate students and $50,000 for professional students—subject to paragraphs (7)(A) and (8).

#### Page 265

Beginning July 1, 2026, aggregate Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford loan caps are $100,000 for graduate students who have not been professional students and $200,000 for professional students, with cross-category borrowers limited to $200,000 minus amounts borrowed in the other category; “graduate student” means enrollment in a program awarding a nonprofessional graduate credential, and “professional student” means enrollment in a program awarding a professional degree per 34 CFR 668.2. Beginning July 1, 2026, parent borrowers for a dependent student face a total maximum annual Federal Direct PLUS loan cap of $20,000, with aggregate limits addressed but not detailed in the provided text.

#### Page 266

Beginning July 1, 2026, the law sets a $257,500 lifetime aggregate borrowing cap for students (excluding parent PLUS loans) regardless of amounts repaid/forgiven/canceled, requires proportional reductions in annual loan amounts for less-than-full-time enrollment per a Secretary-published schedule, and allows institutions to impose consistent program-level annual loan caps for students and parent borrowers. An interim exception preserves prior loan limits for individuals who, as of June 30, 2026, are enrolled and have received loans for their program, during an expected time to credential defined as the lesser of three academic years or a period calculated by the difference between the program’s length and another measure specified in the statute.

#### Page 267

It defines program length as the minimum time specified by an institution’s official materials for a full-time student to complete a specific program. Borrowers with income-contingent loans must select an applicable income-based repayment plan before July 1, 2028 and begin repayment by that date (or earlier), and those who do not choose will be automatically enrolled by the Secretary into the Repayment Assistance Plan or income-based repayment, as eligible.

#### Page 268

The text amends repayment provisions by adding date-based eligibility for borrowers with loans made before July 1, 2026, adjusting references to income-contingent repayment before June 30, 2028, replacing certain consolidation loan language with excepted Consolidation Loan, removing the partial financial hardship phrase, and establishing an income-based Repayment Assistance Plan beginning July 1, 2026 that excludes excepted loans and requires borrowers to use it for all applicable loans. It updates paragraph (5)(B) to permit repayment under subsection (q) or section 493C and creates a sunset limiting pre–July 1, 2026 plans to earlier loans while prohibiting the Secretary from authorizing or modifying any other repayment plans for loans made on or after July 1, 2026, with new plan design and selection commencing July 1, 2026.

#### Page 269

Borrowers with loans under this part on or after July 1, 2026 (including those with earlier loans) may accelerate payments without penalty and choose either a standard fixed-payment plan with a term tied to total outstanding principal—10 years (<$25,000), 15 years ($25,000–<$50,000), 20 years ($50,000–<$100,000), or 25 years ($100,000+)—or the income-based Repayment Assistance Plan. If a borrower does not choose, the Secretary assigns the standard plan; the chosen plan must apply to all loans under this part except any ineligible “excepted” loans that are repaid separately, and borrowers may switch between the standard and Repayment Assistance plans at any time.

#### Page 270

Beginning July 1, 2026, borrowers with “excepted loans”—dependent-student Federal Direct PLUS Loans and certain Federal Direct Consolidation Loans used to discharge those liabilities—must repay them under the standard repayment plan and may prepay without penalty. The law repeals income-contingent repayment authority, updates statutory references to income-based repayment, and allows the Secretary to require defaulted borrowers with assigned loans to use an income-based plan, with corresponding updates to consolidation provisions.

#### Page 271

The law amends multiple provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to replace references to income-contingent repayment with income-based repayment under section 493C, including changes to sections 485(d)(1) and 494(a)(2), effective July 1, 2028. It also establishes a new income-based Repayment Assistance Plan in section 455(q) beginning July 1, 2026, under which a borrower’s total monthly payment across all loans equals an applicable monthly amount calculated under paragraph (4)(B), with the option to pay more.

#### Page 272

The statute sets the order of applying payments (interest, fees, then principal) and defers unpaid principal, and requires borrowers not in deferment or forbearance to make applicable monthly payments until the balance is $0 or they have made 360 qualifying payments, at which point any remaining principal and interest are canceled if they participated in the Repayment Assistance Plan and their most recent payment was under it. A qualifying monthly payment includes on-time payments under the plan, standard plan payments at least equal to required amounts, payments under other plans meeting the 10-year standard equivalency, payments under section 493C and certain income-contingent plans made before July 1, 2028 (including minimum amounts), and months of deferment for specified reasons such as economic hardship.

#### Page 273

A month ending before enactment in which a borrower made no payment due to specified deferment or forbearance is included for purposes of this subsection, and annual eligibility for the Repayment Assistance Plan must be determined under section 493C(c) with verification of income and amount due, an option to opt out of certain disclosures under section 494(a)(2), and allowance for alternative income documentation when adjusted gross income is unavailable or not reflective of current income. For distressed borrowers making on-time payments, any unpaid accrued interest for the month is not charged, and if (while not in deferment or forbearance) the payment reduces principal by less than $50, the Secretary will further reduce principal by the difference between the lesser of $50 or the total monthly payment and the portion of the payment applied to principal.

#### Page 274

It defines a borrower's adjusted gross income per Internal Revenue Code section 62 (including a spouse’s income unless married filing separately) and sets the applicable monthly payment as the applicable base payment divided by 12 minus $50 for each dependent (limited to dependents the borrower claims if married filing separately), with a $10 minimum and, for loans repaid under the Repayment Assistance Plan, a final payment equal to the outstanding balance when that balance is lower than the calculated amount. It establishes a tiered applicable base payment linked to adjusted gross income: $120 for AGI not more than $10,000, then 1% for more than $10,000 up to $20,000, increasing by one percentage point for each $10,000 bracket up to 9% for more than $90,000 up to $100,000.

#### Page 275

For borrowers with adjusted gross income above $100,000 the applicable percentage is 10 percent, "dependent" is defined by reference to Internal Revenue Code section 152, and a special rule requires borrowers who fail to provide required information to pay the sum of their standard 10-year fixed monthly payments on each loan until they comply. Federal Direct Consolidation Loans made on or after July 1, 2026 may be repaid only under specified plans, and the law revises "excepted consolidation loan" to include certain consolidation loans used to discharge liability on excepted PLUS loans or related consolidation loans, while excluding any such loan that, between enactment and June 30, 2028, was being repaid under the Income Contingent Repayment plan.

#### Page 276

The page amends income-driven repayment by terminating the partial financial hardship eligibility requirement, defining the applicable amount as 15% of the borrower’s (and spouse’s, if applicable) adjusted gross income above 150% of the poverty line for the borrower’s family size, and permitting eligible Part B or D borrowers (excluding excepted PLUS and excepted consolidation loans) to cap aggregate monthly payments at one-twelfth of that amount, with repayment also allowed under Title 34 CFR plans as of June 30, 2023 or another income-driven repayment plan. It further provides that if the IBR-calculated payment exceeds the borrower’s initial standard 10-year amount (or the borrower opts out) then the maximum payment is the standard amount and the term may exceed 10 years, updates cross-references (including to section 455(d)(1)(D) as it existed before repeal of 455(e)), adds reference to the Repayment Assistance Program under section 455(q), and initiates provisions for eligibility determinations and automatic recertification.

#### Page 277

The Secretary must establish annual procedures to verify income and determine payment amounts for income-based repayment of most part B or D loans (excluding excepted PLUS and consolidation loans), considering prior procedures under section 455(e)(1) and income-sensitive repayment schedules. The law requires automatic recertification using IRS return information with borrower/spouse opt-out and update options, applies to borrowers who select IBR or recertify income/family size after these procedures are established, amends section 493C(e) to limit special terms for new borrowers to those after July 1, 2014 and before July 1, 2026, and makes the amendments effective upon enactment.

#### Page 278

The law removes the "partial financial hardship" qualifier from FFEL provisions and revises Direct Loan deferment/forbearance by ending unemployment and economic hardship deferments for loans made on or after July 1, 2027 and capping forbearance on such loans at 9 months within any 24-month period. It increases loan rehabilitation limits to allow two rehabilitations for FFEL, Direct, and Perkins loans effective July 1, 2027, sets a $10 minimum total monthly payment for borrowers with one or more Direct Loans made on or after that date under the rehabilitation provision, and amends the Public Service Loan Forgiveness provision.

#### Page 279

It revises statutory clauses, including updating clause (iv) and adding a new clause (v) to count on-time payments under a Repayment Assistance Plan (subsection (q)), and allocates $1,000,000,000, available until expended, for administrative costs including servicing of direct student loan programs under the Higher Education Act. It also amends Pell Grant eligibility by redefining adjusted gross income, beginning with academic years on or after July 1, 2026, to include specified foreign income for both dependent students’ parents and independent students (and spouses) based on the second prior tax year, and sunsets a provision in section 401(b)(1)(D) to apply only to academic years before July 1, 2026.

#### Page 280

Amendments to the Higher Education Act revise Section 479A(b)(1)(B) (including striking clause (v), redesignating subsequent clauses, and inserting wording), and make students ineligible for Pell Grants in any academic year when their student aid index equals or exceeds twice the total maximum Pell Grant, effective July 1, 2026. The law establishes Workforce Pell Grants beginning with the July 1, 2026 award year for otherwise Pell-eligible students enrolled in eligible workforce programs and not holding or pursuing graduate credentials, awarded under the same terms as Pell Grants with references to “eligible program” replaced by “eligible workforce program.”

#### Page 281

Subsection (d)(2) does not apply to eligible workforce programs, students in programs shorter than an academic year may receive prorated Workforce Pell Grants, double benefits are prohibited with subsections (b) or (c), and any covered study counts toward the Pell duration limit. To qualify, a non-correspondence program of 150 to 600 clock hours offered over 8 to 15 weeks must be determined by the State Governor (after consulting the State board) to align with high-skill, high-wage or in-demand sectors, meet employer hiring requirements, and either lead to a stackable, portable recognized credential or prepare students for an occupation with only one recognized credential.

#### Page 282

The page sets conditions for a program to qualify, including awarding a recognized credential upon completion, preparing students to pursue related certificates or degrees by ensuring accepted academic credit, gubernatorial determination of compliance, and subsequent Secretary verification that the program has operated at least one year with a ≥70% completion rate within 150% of normal time, a ≥70% job placement rate 180 days after completion, and total tuition and fees not exceeding the program’s value-added earnings (median earnings of aided completers adjusted by regional price parities minus 150% of the poverty line) of students who completed three years earlier. It defines “eligible institution” and “Governor,” incorporates Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act definitions for certain terms, and sets an effective date of July 1, 2026 for the amendments.

#### Page 283

The law increases the Pell shortfall amount to $12.67 billion and, effective July 1, 2026, bars Pell eligibility during periods when a student’s non-Federal grant aid equals or exceeds their cost of attendance. It adds accountability by requiring institutions to assure compliance starting July 1, 2026 and by prohibiting use of funds for enrollment in degree or certificate programs whose cohorts of Title IV-funded completers, measured four years after completion and not enrolled elsewhere, have median earnings below the applicable comparison level for at least two of the three years immediately before the determination.

#### Page 284

A "working adult" for median earnings comparisons is defined as age 25–34, not enrolled in higher education, with only a high school diploma for baccalaureate or lesser programs or only a bachelor’s degree for graduate/professional programs. Median earnings must be sourced from Bureau of the Census data, using state or national figures based on student residency and, for graduate/professional programs, selecting the lowest applicable median among state and field-specific measures or, if fewer than half of students are in-state, the lower of national overall or national field-specific, with an additional provision addressing cohorts under 30 individuals.

#### Page 285

Procedures are established for evaluating educational programs’ cohort median earnings, including aggregating additional years and equivalent-length cohorts to reach at least 30 students, providing an appeals process before loss of eligibility, mandatory student notices after one year of low earnings within a three-year covered period, and a Secretary-established pathway to regain eligibility after at least two years of ineligibility. Regulatory relief delays, effective upon enactment, the 2022 borrower defense to repayment regulations in 34 CFR part 685 subpart D for loans first originating before July 1, 2035, rendering those provisions inapplicable to such loans.

#### Page 286

Regulations in effect on July 1, 2020 are restored, and the 2022 amendments to closed school discharge rules are not in effect for loans first originating before July 1, 2035, with the pre-amendment provisions remaining in force. It appropriates $40,000,000 to the National Endowment for the Humanities through fiscal year 2028 to procure statues under Executive Orders 13934, 13978, and 14189, and $300,000,000 to the Office of Refugee Resettlement through September 30, 2028 to fund background checks on potential sponsors of unaccompanied alien children, including collecting the names and Social Security or taxpayer identification numbers of sponsors and all adult residents of their households.

#### Page 287

The law specifies vetting and placement safeguards for unaccompanied alien children, requiring sponsor and household member dates of birth, residence validation, interviews and suitability studies, contact information, comprehensive background and fingerprint-based criminal checks, home studies, examination and covering of gang-related tattoos, improved data systems to assess sponsor appropriateness and identify child labor exploitation and trafficking, and coordination with state child welfare agencies, and defines “potential sponsor” and “unaccompanied alien child.” It also appropriates $46,550,000,000 to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for fiscal year 2025, available through September 30, 2029, for elements of the border infrastructure and wall system.

#### Page 288

Authorizes border barrier-related projects including constructing or improving primary, waterborne, and secondary barriers, access roads, barrier system attributes (cameras, lights, sensors, and other detection technology), and ground preparation and maintenance to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection operations. It appropriates for fiscal year 2025 $4,100,000,000 (available through September 30, 2029) to hire and train CBP personnel, $2,052,630,000 (through September 30, 2029) for recruitment/performance/retention bonuses, $855,000,000 (through September 30, 2029) for patrol vehicles, and $5,000,000,000 for facilities and checkpoints; bars use of these funds to recruit, hire, or train processing coordinators after October 31, 2028; and provides ICE $45,000,000,000 (through September 30, 2029) for single adult and family detention capacity, allowing family detention pending and until removal with adult detention standards set at the DHS Secretary’s discretion, and defining a “family residential center” as a DHS facility detaining family units of aliens (including alien children who are not unaccompanied).

#### Page 289

Appropriates $6,168,000,000 to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for FY2025, available until September 30, 2029, for AI- and machine learning-enabled nonintrusive inspection equipment and civil works, air and marine response platform upgrades, border surveillance technologies, biometric entry-exit deployment, screening of persons and initial screenings of unaccompanied alien children consistent with the TVPRA, combating drug trafficking including fentanyl, and commemorating border security efforts. It prohibits spending on surveillance towers along the southwest and northern borders unless tested and accepted by CBP to deliver autonomous capabilities—defined as real-time AI/ML/computer vision systems that accurately detect, identify, classify, and track items of interest and adjust operations without continuous human control—and also allocates funds to FEMA through September 30, 2029 to administer the State Homeland Security Grant Program to enhance State, local, and Tribal security.

#### Page 290

Appropriates $500,000,000 for State and local UAS threat detection, $625,000,000 for 2026 FIFA World Cup security, $1,000,000,000 for 2028 Olympics security and planning, and $450,000,000 for Operation Stonegarden, while exempting the World Cup and Olympics funds from specified Homeland Security Act requirements. Establishes a State Border Security Reinforcement Fund in DHS to grant States and localities funds for southern border barriers and related ground work, detecting and interdicting illicit substances and unlawful entrants who have committed crimes and transferring them to DHS, and relocating unlawfully present aliens from small population centers, with $10,000,000,000 available through September 30, 2034, eligibility for activities on or after January 20, 2021, and State application requirements.

#### Page 291

States must submit applications stating the purposes and allocation plans for funds, with acceptance starting no later than 90 days after enactment, and no State or local government is authorized to exercise immigration or border security powers reserved to the Federal Government, while FEMA may use up to 1 percent of the subsection’s funds to administer grants. The law appropriates $300,000,000 to FEMA for FY2025 through September 30, 2029 to reimburse extraordinary law enforcement personnel costs directly attributable to protection activities to be secured by the United States Secret Service at nongovernmental properties designated under the Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976 (for costs incurred on or after July 1, 2024 and certified as requested by the Secret Service), with up to 3 percent for administration, and appropriates $10,000,000,000 to DHS through September 30, 2029 to reimburse activities supporting border safeguarding.

#### Page 292

The FEHB Protection Act of 2025 defines key terms and directs the OPM Director, within one year of enactment, to issue regulations and implement processes to verify qualifying life events and confirm that individuals added as family members to health benefits plans, including during open season, are eligible. It further requires fraud risk assessments to address ineligible enrollments, mandates a three-year audit beginning one year after enactment to verify family member eligibility through document review, and within 180 days compels development of a process for disenrollment or removal.

This subtitle applies immigration-related fees to aliens as described, adopts the definitions in section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and treats any references as references to that Act unless expressly provided otherwise. It imposes an asylum application fee due at filing—set in FY 2025 at the greater of $100 or a rule-established amount by the Secretary or Attorney General, adjusted annually for inflation from FY 2026 using the CPI-U and rounded down to the next lowest $10—and provides that 50 percent of fees from applications filed with the Attorney General are credited to the Executive Office for Immigration Review for retention and expenditure without further appropriation, while also addressing fees from applications filed with the Secretary of Homeland Security.

#### Page 295

Certain fees are credited to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for deposit into the Immigration Examinations Fee Account and may be expended without further appropriation, with any amounts not credited to the Executive Office for Immigration Review or USCIS deposited into the Treasury’s general fund, and fee waivers or reductions are prohibited. Section 100003 requires asylum applicants to pay a fee with initial employment authorization applications—set in FY2025 at the greater of $550 or a DHS rule-established amount, adjusted annually by CPI—and allocates 25% of collected fees to USCIS via that account, with at least half of that share used to detect and prevent immigration benefit fraud.

#### Page 331

The Act amends Section 8(a) of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act by replacing the prior deadline “2 years after the date of enactment of the RECA Extension Act of 2022” with “December 31, 2027.” H.R. 1 passed the House on May 21, 2025, passed the Senate with amendments on June 28 and 30, the House concurred on July 2, and it was approved July 4, 2025, with Presidential remarks recorded that day.
