## Executive Summary

Timken presents a comprehensive engineering resource that combines product selection guidance, application analysis, and practical mounting practice for a wide range of bearing types. The manual is designed to help engineers select spherical roller bearing solid‑block housed units as well as tapered, cylindrical, spherical, ball, thrust, and angular contact bearings, with dimensions, tolerances, load ratings, and engineering advice provided in both metric and inch units. It reflects Timken’s broader capabilities in metallurgy, friction management, and mechanical power transmission, supported by global technology centers and integrated services such as repair and condition monitoring. References throughout follow international standards and terminology, and Timken engineers are available for consultation on complex applications.

Across bearing families, the manual compares performance for radial, axial, and combined loads, stiffness and moment capacity, friction, misalignment accommodation, positioning (fixed vs float), and speed. Tapered roller bearings offer excellent combined-load and moment performance with high stiffness; spherical roller designs excel at continuous self-alignment under harsh conditions; cylindrical roller bearings provide robust radial load capacity; and ball and angular contact bearings deliver high-speed capability with options tailored to thrust direction and rigidity. The portfolio spans miniature, instrument, and thin‑section precision ball bearings in advanced materials (including stainless and ceramic options) for demanding medical, aerospace, and measurement systems, as well as super precision angular contact and deep-groove designs optimized for machine tool spindles and other high-speed machinery.

Tapered roller solutions range from single‑row TS (with TSF flanged variants) to double‑row TDO and TDI/TDIT assemblies pre‑set with spacers for fixed and floating positions. Non‑adjustable double‑row TNA/TNASW/TNASWE variants simplify assembly and sealing on stationary shafts, while spacer assemblies and standardized pre‑set techniques provide low‑cost, ready‑to‑fit alternatives. Three basic spacer mounting arrangements (indirect, direct, and tandem) leverage pairs of single‑row bearings to control spread, position, and combined capacities. Four‑row tapered bearings serve mill roll necks in sealed and preset designs. Specialized variants include high‑speed TSMA/TSMR with directed rib lubrication, heavy‑duty TNASWH/TNASWHF assemblies for levellers and rail wheels, and precision Hydra‑Rib bearings that allow preload control under changing conditions. TXR crossed roller bearings deliver large effective spread and exceptional resistance to overturning moments. For simplified installation and logistics, Timken offers packaged pre‑set and sealed assemblies for automotive and rail applications, including wheel hub units and compact journal bearings.

In complementary rolling elements, radial spherical roller bearings are offered in redesigned EJ/EM/EMB and large-bore YM/YMB/YMD/YP styles with cage choices, higher load ratings, improved thermal performance, and optional lubrication grooves; vibration‑tuned W800 options add tighter running accuracy and markings for optimized assembly. Cylindrical roller bearing coverage includes EMA one‑piece brass‑cage designs that lower friction and heat, full‑complement types for high radial capacity with one‑direction axial capability, standard NU/N/NJ/NF/NUP/NP configurations that define axial freedom and thrust support, and a 5200 series with elevated radial capacity. Ball bearing options include deep‑groove designs in Conrad and filling‑slot constructions and snap‑ring versions to simplify compact housings, as well as single‑ and double‑row angular contact bearings configured for high one‑direction thrust capacity and duplexed rigidity. Thrust products span ball types for lighter loads and high speeds, cylindrical designs for heavy axial loads and initial misalignment accommodation, spherical thrust with continuous alignment and low friction, tapered thrust for extreme thrust and shock, and V‑flat styles for very high static and dynamic capacities in heavily loaded equipment.

Cage technology is detailed to align strength, guidance, thermal resistance, and lubrication behavior with application demands. Cylindrical roller cages include stamped steel for mass‑production and chemical resistance, premium machined brass that reduces drag and wear, and pin‑type constructions for very large diameters that accommodate additional rollers. Spherical roller cages range from Timken’s unique nitrided, face‑slotted stamped‑steel designs that improve lubrication and resist bending to precision machined-brass and pin‑type variants for higher complements and rugged service. Tapered roller cages are offered in stamped steel, polymer for pre‑greased sealed units, machined alloy steel for high speed and load, and pin‑type designs for large sizes, while ball bearing cages include pressed steel, molded nylon, phenolic, and robust brass/steel options, each with temperature and lubricant compatibility considerations.

A clear, four‑step selection process guides users from bearing type choice through dimensional constraints, operating environment and application requirements, to life calculation and optimization. The manual provides methods to resolve bearing reactions for shafts on two supports, showing how different bearing types locate effective load centers and how spherical roller bearings carry radial and axial loads without supporting external moments. It includes formulas for gear, worm, and belt/chain forces to build realistic load cases, and it explains dynamic and static ratings, equivalent loads for each bearing family, minimum load requirements, and misalignment limits. Life prediction starts with statistical L10 concepts and extends to application‑specific adjustments for reliability, material quality, lubrication film adequacy, contamination (with debris signature considerations), low‑load benefits, and grease aging. Duty cycles are addressed with weighted‑load/speed methods and system reliability is treated as a function of individual bearing reliabilities. Guidance on torque estimation, minimum speed to avoid skidding, and speed/viscosity factors supports performance prediction and lubrication selection.

Extensive dimensional accuracy and fit guidance is provided. The manual consolidates ISO/ABMA tolerance classes and tabulates inner/outer ring bore, outside diameter, width, stand, and runout tolerances for ball, cylindrical, spherical, tapered, and thrust bearings, in both metric and inch systems. It translates these standards into practical shaft and housing fit charts across operating conditions—emphasizing interference fits for rotating rings to prevent creep and tailored fits for stationary rings depending on load severity, speed, and the need for axial float. Special considerations cover light‑metal housings (with minimum interference criteria or steel inserts), thin‑walled members, and non‑steel materials. For precision spindles, the manual defines geometry and surface finish requirements, advocates grinding seats and shoulders in a single setup, and provides shoulder diameter recommendations and housing practice to minimize runout and enhance stability.

Mounting and setting practices are described in stepwise detail. Interference fits reduce internal clearance and increase effective width, so mounted settings must account for fit effects, thermal gradients, and load‑induced deflection to achieve near‑zero operating settings preferred for long life. For tapered roller bearings, the relationship between bench settings, mounted endplay/preload, and operating setting is quantified, including temperature and deflection influences and adjustments for direct versus indirect mounting. For spherical roller bearings with tapered bores, the procedure uses measured radial internal clearance reduction and associated axial drive‑up to reach the target mounted clearance, with example drive‑up values for common taper ratios and checks against minimum permissible clearance. The manual covers fixed/floating arrangements, combinations of spherical and cylindrical bearings to accommodate shaft growth, and the thermal sensitivity of three‑support versus two‑support designs. For precision ball and angular contact bearings, preload selection (light to heavy) balances stiffness, speed, and life; duplex mounting options (back‑to‑back, face‑to‑face, tandem) and higher‑order sets (triplex, quadruplex) are evaluated for axial capacity, moment resistance, and thermal behavior, with spacer accuracy and alignment emphasized.

Proper handling, storage, and shelf‑life management are integral to performance. The manual recommends leaving products in their original packaging until installation, storing in clean, dry, temperature‑controlled environments, and avoiding vibration and contaminants. It clarifies that corrosion‑preventive coatings are not lubricants, outlines when cleaning is necessary, and cautions against using components past their shelf‑life limits. Safety and compliance guidance includes avoiding hazardous practices (such as spinning with compressed air or heating without removing inhibitors), following correct press‑fit procedures, and observing regulatory requirements for lubricants and materials in specific markets.

Lubrication and sealing guidance is thorough. Oil is preferred at higher speeds and for heat removal, delivered via bath, circulation, mist, or air‑oil systems with attention to entry points, flow control, and filtration. Grease simplifies sealing and maintenance; the manual explains thickener and base‑oil choices, temperature capability, rheology, compatibility, and the strong influence of operating temperature on grease life. It recommends initial fills (typically one‑third to one‑half full), purging practices, relubrication intervals based on temperature and sealing efficiency, and methods for packing tapered and rolling element bearings. Viscosity and speed selection tools include charts for ISO grades, temperature–viscosity behavior, and speed/viscosity factors used in life models. Seal and closure options—labyrinths with annular grooves, contacting lips, DUO FACE‑PLUS, diaphragm and mechanical face seals, V‑rings, felt and rubber designs, and robust multi‑lip shrouded seals—are matched to lubricant type, speed, and contamination levels, with design advice on surface finishes, clearances, and protection in gritty environments.

Thermal performance and speed capability are treated as system issues driven by heat generation and dissipation. The manual outlines material stabilization ranges, component temperature limits, and realistic operating targets to protect fits, lubrication films, and component life. It ties bearing torque to heat generation and provides cooling estimates for circulating oil systems, while also presenting reference speed guidelines for ball and roller bearings under standardized conditions and defining rib speed for tapered roller bearings. Designers are encouraged to validate thermal behavior through testing when operating near limits.

Throughout, the content reflects Timken’s focus on practical application engineering: it translates standards and theory into selection steps, fit charts, mounting procedures, and maintenance practices; it links load sources to bearing reactions and life; and it integrates lubrication, sealing, and thermal management into reliable designs. Access to catalogs, mobile tools, application‑specific greases, and global engineering support underscores the aim to improve uptime, simplify assembly, and optimize bearing performance across industries.

#### Page 6

Timken presents itself as a leader in bearing technology, producing multiple bearing types and emphasizing quality, reliability, and the capability of anti-friction bearings to handle varied speeds, radial/thrust loads, and challenging environments. This engineering section serves as a practical guide—advising consultation with Timken engineers for complex applications—and outlines topics including bearing and cage designs, life analysis, tolerances, fitting and mounting, operating temperatures, speed ratings, lubrication, and seal options.

#### Page 7

This catalog is designed to help you select Timken spherical roller bearing solid-block housed units, offering an extensive range of bearings and accessories in both imperial and metric sizes with ranges shown in millimeters and inches and support available from Timken engineers. It provides dimensions, tolerances, load ratings, and engineering guidance on shaft and housing fits, internal clearances, materials, and other bearing features to aid initial selection, and clarifies that ISO and ANSI/ABMA refer to the International Organization for Standardization and the American National Standards Institute/American Bearing Manufacturers Association.

#### Page 8

Timken explains that shelf life for grease-lubricated ball and roller bearings, components and assemblies is the pre-installation period and only a portion of design life, varies with factors like lubricant bleed, oil migration, operating/installation conditions, temperature, humidity and storage, and that published shelf-life values are maximums assuming proper storage/handling, with deviations or shorter specifications reducing shelf life; they cannot predict in-service lubricant performance and are not responsible for shelf life when another party performs lubrication. For EU imports, Timken lubricants and greases in containers or delivery systems must comply with REACH and be registered with ECHA; contact a Timken engineer for further information.

#### Page 9

Timken advises storing bearings, components, and assemblies in their original packaging with labels intact until use; reseal bulk containers, place items into service promptly once unboxed, avoid using products past shelf life, and maintain clean, dry storage between 0 and 40 C with humidity below 60%, minimal temperature fluctuation, no undue vibration, and no airborne contaminants, avoiding any extreme conditions (stricter requirements may apply). Because most components ship with a corrosion-preventive compound that is not a lubricant, they may go into oil-lubricated service without removal but may require cleaning before certain grease applications; housed units are generally pre-packed with general-purpose grease that may need frequent replenishment, lubricant compatibility must be considered, units can be ordered with specified lubrication, and products should stay packaged until mounting to prevent contamination and corrosion.

#### Page 10

Timken outlines critical safety and handling practices: follow installation instructions and maintain proper lubrication; never spin bearings with compressed air; remove oil or rust inhibitor before heating to avoid fire and fumes; avoid mixing greases and follow equipment-specific lubrication guidance; and never apply press-fit pressure to the wrong bearing ring. The catalog is provided only as an aid for analysis and selection with no expressed or implied warranties and no liability for errors, performance must be validated by the user, products are sold under Timken’s terms and limited warranty, compliance considerations include REACH (including EU lubricant registration), RoHS, ATEX, CE marking and Conflict Minerals, and additional warnings, manuals (order 10424), and updates are available at timken.com or from Timken engineers.

#### Page 11

The bearing selection process involves four steps: choosing the optimal bearing type based on design and performance rankings, defining size constraints (bore, outside diameter, width) from shaft and housing limits, evaluating environmental conditions (temperature, load, speed, cleanliness) and application requirements (fits, setting, lubricant, cage, flange), and performing life calculations to select the bearing with the best overall performance. Additional guidance includes detailed analysis in subsequent sections and the option to contact a Timken engineer or access catalogs and mobile apps for further resources.

#### Page 12

The page enumerates Timken bearing types including tapered and thrust tapered roller, cylindrical and thrust cylindrical roller, spherical and thrust spherical roller, radial and thrust ball, and angular contact ball. A comparative table rates their performance for radial, axial, and combined loads, moment loading, stiffness, friction, misalignment, locating versus non-locating positions, and speed, highlighting that tapered rollers are excellent for combined and moment loads with high stiffness, spherical designs excel at misalignment, thrust types handle pure axial load, and radial and angular contact ball bearings deliver excellent speed with radial ball bearings also offering excellent low friction.

#### Page 13

Radial deep-groove ball bearings handle primarily radial loads with some thrust capability; non-filling-slot (Conrad, suffix K) designs are limited in capacity because only part of the raceway can be filled with balls, while filling-slot (suffix W) versions accept more balls to boost radial capacity at the cost of reduced thrust capacity. Snap ring (Wireloc, suffix G) bearings incorporate a ring in an outer-ring groove to act as a housing shoulder, simplifying through-bored mounting and enabling compact designs (e.g., transmissions) without reducing bearing capacity, with snap ring placement options relative to shields or seals and shear thrust capacity exceeding that of the bearing.

#### Page 14

Single-row angular contact ball bearings handle combined loads with high one-direction thrust capacity, are dimensionally interchangeable with single-row radial bearings, achieve higher thrust capacity via a large contact angle, deep rings and maximum ball complement assembled through an outer-ring counterbore, and are used in applications such as gear reducers, pumps, worm drives, vertical shafts and machine tool spindles. Double-row angular contact ball bearings, essentially akin to a duplex pair, provide greater axial and radial rigidity for heavy radial, thrust or combined loads but, being largely of filling-slot construction, have less thrust capacity than equivalent-size duplexed single-row angular contact bearings; they are offered in fixed and floating mountings, with smaller sizes using polymer retainers.

#### Page 15

Timken produces miniature, instrument, and thin-section precision ball bearings and assemblies with bores from 1 mm to 279.40 mm, built to ISO P5/ABEC 5 to ISO P4/ABEC 7 tolerances and offered in materials such as 440C stainless, 52100, and ceramic or titanium-carbide-coated balls for demanding surgical/diagnostic devices, precision pumps, measurement and material handling equipment, and guidance, weapons, and space applications. Offerings include deep-groove radial bearings for radial/thrust/combined loads (with machined phenolic cages, shields/seals, and optional flanges), angular contact designs with increased ball complement and contact angle for maximum axial stiffness and preloaded high-speed precision, fractured ring bearings with banded split outer rings enabling full-complement capacity in limited cross-section/width installations, pivot bearings that use the shaft as the inner raceway for low-torque, high power density in gyros, and thrust ball bearings with all-stainless components for inert environments requiring high axial load, low speed, and relatively high torque.

#### Page 16

Timken’s high-precision tapered roller options include TS/TSF single-row bearings for accurate rotation, Hydra-Rib bearings with hydraulically or pneumatically controlled preload, and TXR crossed roller bearings (TXRDO design) whose steep tapered geometry yields a large effective spread and high resistance to overturning moments, with Precision Plus variants achieving sub-micron radial runout. Their super precision angular contact ball bearings for machine tool spindles exceed ISO/ABMA tolerances and are offered across four ISO series with WI, HX, WN, and K geometries, 15° or 25° contact angles, and ceramic ball options to balance capacity, stiffness, and speed, including deep-groove K-type bearings capable of thrust loads in both directions.

#### Page 17

Timken deep-groove super precision ball bearings have relatively high-speed capability—especially with light axial preload—and are offered in ISO 10 (9100K), ISO 02 (200K), and ISO 03 (300K) dimensional series. Suitable for mounting on straight shafts and often supplied with spherical outer rings for self-alignment in pillow blocks or flanged housings, these include self-locking (eccentric) collar bearings that eliminate extra hardware and grip the shaft with a supplemental setscrew, setscrew series (GYA-RRB and GY-KRRB) that can be relubricated and use land-riding R-Seals with extended vs wide inner ring options depending on space and stability needs, and concentric collar units locked by two setscrews 120 degrees apart for limited-space, reversing-rotation applications.

#### Page 18

The single-row TS tapered roller bearing is the basic, most widely used type, comprising an inner ring assembly and an outer ring, typically installed as an opposing pair and set during assembly to the desired clearance (endplay) or preload; the TSF variant adds a flanged outer ring to facilitate axial location and accurately aligned seats in a through-bored housing. Double-row designs include TDO, with a one-piece double outer ring, two single inner rings, and an inner-ring spacer supplied as a pre-set assembly that yields a wide effective bearing spread for overturning moments and can be used in fixed or floating positions in the housing bore to compensate for shaft expansion (TDOCD outer rings add O.D. holes for pinning to prevent outer ring rotation), and TDI/TDIT, which have a one-piece double inner ring and two single outer rings, are usually supplied with an outer-ring spacer as a pre-set assembly for fixed positions on rotating shafts (with TDI able to float on a stationary shaft in rotating housing applications) and with TDIT using a tapered bore to ease removal when an interference fit is essential yet regular removal is required.

#### Page 19

Types TNA, TNASW, and TNASWE are double-row, non-adjustable tapered roller bearings with a one-piece outer ring and abutting extended inner-ring faces that provide built-in clearance for a standard setting range; TNASW adds chamfers and lubricant slots for shaft lubrication, while TNASWE also has extended back face ribs ground on the O.D. to accept seals or closures, making these designs suitable for stationary shaft applications and simplifying fixed or floating assemblies. Spacer assemblies combine two single-row TS bearings with machined spacers to create pre-set, ready-to-fit double-row units in 2S and SR variants, where 2S uses an inner-ring spacer and a snap-ring that doubles as the outer-ring spacer to provide axial location in a through-bored housing with a specified setting range, and SR employs Timken’s SET-RIGHT standard setting technique with two spacers and an optional snap-ring, with assembly width adjustable by spacer thickness for a low-cost solution.

#### Page 20

Three basic spacer-assembly mounting arrangements for tapered roller bearings are 2TS-IM (indirect), 2TS-DM (direct), and 2TS-TM (tandem). 2TS-IM uses two single-row bearings with inner- and outer-ring spacers (the outer spacer may be replaced by a housing shoulder), 2TS-DM uses two single-row bearings with abutting inner rings and an outer-ring spacer for fixed locating positions on rotating shafts, and 2TS-TM mounts two single-row bearings in tandem to handle combined radial and thrust loads beyond a single bearing’s capacity within a given maximum O.D., with appropriate spacers supplied and engineering consultation recommended.

#### Page 21

Timken packaged tapered roller bearings are ready-to-install, pre-set and sealed assemblies that improve reliability, simplify assembly, and streamline logistics, with certain versions also pre-lubricated. Pinion Pac serves heavy-vehicle differential pinions; UNIPAC/UNIPAC‑PLUS are flanged double‑row wheel-hub/industrial units (UNIPAC‑PLUS sealed and lubricated for the reasonable life, suited to moderate‑to‑heavy loads and reduced weight); AP is a self‑contained pre‑set, pre‑lubricated, sealed assembly with defined components originally for railroad journals and now industrial; and SP is a more compact, metric variant for rail journal applications.

#### Page 22

TSMA and TSMR are single-row high-speed tapered roller bearings that ensure lubrication of the roller-to-rib contact by directing oil through inner-ring passages—axial holes fed from an inner-ring manifold for TSMA and radial holes fed from a circumferential inner-bore groove for TSMR. Other double-row options include TDIE (extended double inner ring, cylindrical or self-locking square bore with provisions for locking) and TDIA (extended single inner ring) for securing loose-fitted inner rings and sealing in pillow blocks and agricultural/line shafts, as well as TNASWH/TNASWHF heavy-duty assemblies with thick or flanged outer rings used as steady rest rollers, levellers, or rail wheels, featuring extended counterbored outer rings for closures, optional contacting seals, and pre-lubrication.

#### Page 23

Four-row tapered roller bearings for rolling mill roll necks are supplied as pre-set matched assemblies; TQO/TQOW are directly mounted pairs used with loose fits, with lubrication via slots in inner rings or spacers, and a sealed variant that resists contamination. TOITS/TOITSE use a continuous tapered bore for interference fits on high-speed mills and indirect mounting to widen spread and improve stability, with TOITSE adding an inner-ring extension for a seal surface and greater rigidity, and Timken’s TSL sealed bearing uses a DUO-FACE PLUS seal for grease-lubricated, moderate-speed applications.

#### Page 24

Timken offers a range of thrust bearing types engineered primarily for axial loads—with TVL, DTVL, TTHD and TSR also accommodating radial loads—using large or controlled-contour rolling elements for high capacity and intended to operate under continuous load. Among thrust ball bearings for lighter loads and higher speeds, TVB is a separable grooved-ring design providing one-direction axial rigidity and not for radial loads; TVL is a separable angular-contact design that handles unidirectional thrust and combined loads with low friction, cool, quiet high-speed operation, less misalignment sensitivity, and should always be operated under thrust load; and DTVL adds an extra ring and ball complement to carry moderate thrust in one direction and light in the other.

#### Page 25

Thrust cylindrical roller bearings carry heavy loads at moderate speeds (standard to 3000 fpm/15 m/s), require EP lubricants introduced at the bore, and are built to Timken Standard Tolerances; Type TP has two hardened rings and staggered controlled-contour rollers to prevent raceway grooves and is economical but needs square shaft and housing seats, while Type TPS adds a spherically ground ring and aligning ring to accommodate initial misalignment but not dynamic misalignment. The TSR thrust spherical roller bearing offers high thrust capacity with low friction and continuous alignment, handling pure thrust or combined radial/thrust loads with up to 2.5 degrees axial misalignment in applications like air regenerators and pumps, whereas the TTHD thrust tapered roller bearing uses conical raceways and tapered rollers with a common vertex for true rolling, suits crane hooks and other extreme thrust/shock duties, and can be supplied with a full complement of rollers for very low-speed, heavy loads.

#### Page 26

Two basic types of tapered roller thrust bearings for pure thrust loads are TTC, which uses a full complement of rollers without a cage for slow speeds, and TTSP, a caged design well-suited to oscillating steering pivot motion. V-flat tapered roller bearings—TTHDFL and the self-aligning TTVS—combine thrust tapered and cylindrical features with one flat ring and one tapered raceway to deliver exceptional dynamic and superior static capacity (originally for metal rolling mills with thrust loads over one million pounds), are used in heavily loaded extruders and cone crushers, typically use cages with hardened pins for closer roller spacing (with smaller sizes using cast-brass cages to promote lubrication flow), and TTVS allows self-alignment under initial misalignment but should not be used with dynamic misalignment.

#### Page 27

Timken radial spherical roller bearings are offered in EJ, EM and EMB styles for ≤400 mm OD and YM, YMB, YMD and YP for >400 mm OD, with redesigned EJ/EM/EMB delivering higher load ratings, increased thermal speed ratings and reduced operating temperatures, varied cage designs by style, and availability in cylindrical or K-suffix tapered bores (1:12 taper standard, 1:30 for 240/241/242 series). Optional features include a W33 outer-ring lubrication groove with three oil holes to facilitate lubrication and vibratory-application designs designated W800 with C4 clearance that add P5 running accuracy with marked high/low points, reduced bore and OD tolerances, and availability in cylindrical or tapered bores.

#### Page 28

Timken standard cylindrical roller bearings (NU, N, NJ, NF, NUP, NP) differ by inner/outer ring rib arrangements that define axial location and thrust capability: N/NU allow axial displacement for shaft expansion, NJ/NF carry heavy radial plus light unidirectional thrust, and NUP/NP (with loose ribs) provide bidirectional axial location; the fixed bearing is typically placed near the drive end and lubrication becomes critical as thrust limits are approached. These bearings comply with ISO/DIN (R‑prefix to ABMA) and use ISO 15 part numbers where the first two digits denote width and diameter series and the last two equal bore size divided by 5, with inch-size versions identified by the letter I (e.g., RIU vs RU).

#### Page 29

Timken single-row EMA series cylindrical roller bearings use a one-piece, land-riding brass cage with full-milled pockets plus proprietary ring/roller profiles and engineered surface textures to lower drag, friction and heat, increase load capacity, and extend life, and are available in types N, NU, NJ and NUP. Full-complement (NCF) bearings have integral inner/outer ring flanges to carry axial load in one direction and permit small axial displacement, while the 5200 metric series boosts radial capacity with a double-ribbed outer ring and full-width cylindrical-OD inner ring (or can omit the inner ring if the shaft is HRC 58 min/15 RMS max), offers stamped-steel (S) or optional machined brass (M) land-riding cages, alloy-steel outer rings and deep-case hardened inner rings, standard R6 radial clearance (others on request), and guidance via integral ribs and roller end clearance control.

#### Page 30

Cages in rolling bearings separate and align rolling elements to prevent contact, sliding, skidding, and skewing, retain them for installation, and can improve lubricant flow to raceway or rib surfaces. For tapered roller bearings, cage types include stamped-steel (mass-produced from low-carbon sheet steel and suited to high temperatures and harsh lubricants), polymer nylon/glass-reinforced designs (for pre-greased sealed packages with design flexibility and potential extra rollers but caution with EP additives above 107°C/225°F), machined alloy-steel (robust for high-speed/high-load, with features like nib/staking retention, oil holes, and optional silver plating), and pin-type steel cages (for large >400 mm O.D. bearings allowing more rollers but limited to rib speeds <20 m/s [4000 ft/min]).

#### Page 31

Timken EJ spherical roller bearings use unique stamped-steel cages—two independent, inner-ring-guided cages running above pitch—that are nitrided and face-slotted to improve wear, lubrication flow, operating temperature, and life while resisting cage bending. Large-diameter bearings can use pin-type cages with increased roller complement for higher load capacity, and precision machined-brass cages (EM, EMB, YM, YMB one-piece; YMD two-piece) feature rugged finger-type designs with good lubrication access, with EM/YM roller-guided low-mass cages, EMB/YMB inner-ring-guided higher-mass cages, and YMD enabling independent row rotation and preventing finger bending.

#### Page 32

Cylindrical roller bearing cages include stamped-steel, machined brass, and pin-type designs, each with specific constructions, guidance methods, and application ranges. Stamped-steel S-type cages are mass-producible, tolerate high temperatures and harsh lubricants, and use depressed bridges to space and retain rollers; machined one- or two-piece brass cages (including a premium one-piece land-riding design used in EMA series) provide higher strength and reduce drag, heat, and wear via improved lubrication, while pin-type cages for large diameters use pins through the rollers, can accommodate additional rollers, and increase load capacity.

#### Page 33

Pressed-steel welded cages offer high strength, rigidity, and uniform ball-to-pocket clearance for very high temperatures but do not accommodate misalignment, while molded nylon 66 finger-type and reinforced nylon (30% glass fiber) one-piece cages are self-lubricating, corrosion resistant, usable continuously to 120°C with spikes to 150°C (finger type common in WIR bearings) and the finger type can accommodate misalignment. Machined phenolic one-piece cages are lightweight, oil-absorbing, precisely machinable and high-speed capable but do not retain balls for handling, while brass and steel cages (machined or cast, often ring piloted) handle heavy loads and may be silver plated to prevent start-up skidding, with caution that aggressive EP lubricants above 107°C can be problematic for nylon cages.

#### Page 34

This page provides a summary of symbols used in bearing selection, defining each symbol and its units (metric/inch) for determining applied loads and performing bearing analysis. Covered are life and operating-condition factors (reliability, material, lubrication, debris, load zone), dynamic and static load ratings (radial and axial/thrust), geometric and diameter terms, gear/pinion/worm and belt-related forces (tangential, thrust, separating, resultant), torque coefficients, speed/viscosity/lubrication and thermal parameters, and other variables such as power, effective bearing spread, and endplay.

#### Page 35

A comprehensive glossary of symbols with descriptions and metric/inch units supports bearing selection and analysis, covering factors and constants for load ratings, geometry, runout, torque, speed, reliability, and life. It also includes parameters for gears and worm drives (tooth counts, mesh and helix angles, lead), lubrication and thermal effects (viscosity, density, heat generation/dissipation), clearances and fits, and static/dynamic axial and radial equivalent loads.

#### Page 36

Equations are given to compute gear forces for bearing applications: for spur gears, tangential force derives from power, diameter, and speed with separating force equal to tangential force times the tangent of the pressure angle; for single helical gears, thrust equals tangential force times the tangent of the helix angle and separating force includes a cosine of the helix angle factor. Pinion formulas relate tangential force to power, mean diameter, and speed (with distinct inch/metric constants), while for straight bevel and zerol gears the mean diameter (Dp − b sin Y) is used, tangential forces on gear and pinion are equal, and thrust and separating forces always act in the same direction, with positive thrust away from the pinion apex.

#### Page 37

For straight bevel gears, the tangential force FtG is computed from transmitted power H, mean working diameter DmG, and rotational speed NG as FtG = (1.91 x 10^7) H/(DmG NG) in metric or FtG = (1.26 x 10^5) H/(DmG NG) in inch units, with thrust and separating components given by FaG = FtG tan OG sin YG and FSG = FtG tan OG cos YG. For spiral bevel and hypoid gearing, the directions of thrust and separating forces depend on spiral angle, hand of spiral, rotation direction, and whether the gear is driving or driven (hand determined by near-face tooth curvature and rotation viewed toward the apex), with Ftp = FtG for spiral bevel, hypoid pinion effective working diameter Dmp = DmG (Np cos YG)/(NG cos YP), hypoid gear effective working diameter DmG = DpG − b sin YG, and figures indicating positive thrust is away from and negative thrust toward the pinion apex.

#### Page 38

Equations are provided to compute thrust and separating forces in spiral bevel and hypoid gears for both driving and driven members, with terms tied to tangential force and geometry (pressure and spiral angles) and distinctions for rotation direction and spiral hand. The page also presents straight worm gearing formulas for tangential, thrust, and separating forces in both metric and inch systems, using parameters such as power, pitch diameters, speeds, and angles (pressure and lead/shaft).

Formulas are provided to compute tangential, thrust, and separating forces for worm gears and double-enveloping worm gearing in both metric and inch units, based on transmitted power, diameters, speed, efficiency/ratio, and lead angle, with definitions for lead angle and mean worm diameter. An approximate friction coefficient is given as a function of rubbing velocity over 0.015–15 m/s (3–3000 ft/min), and guidance indicates using tangential force for torque transmission while applying thrust/separating force equations (e.g., FaW ≈ 0.98 FtG) for bearing load calculations on the worm and gear shafts.

#### Page 40

Equations and factors are provided to estimate belt and chain pull (using chain pitch and sprocket mean diameter), with pull factors of 1.00 for single chain, 1.25 for double chain, and 1.50 for V-belts. Guidance is given on shock loads (a suddenly applied load is at least twice static), centrifugal force from imbalance, and the relationships linking tractive effort, power, wheel speed, and vehicle speed in metric and inch units.

#### Page 41

Bearing reactions for a shaft on two supports are found by defining the effective bearing spread, resolving applied loads into components, and summing moments about the bearings’ effective centers; for tapered roller and angular contact ball bearings, treating the shaft as supported at these centers allows bearing moments to be ignored when calculating radial loads. In spherical roller bearings the effective center coincides with the geometric center, giving zero internal moment arm and self-aligning capability that prevents support of external moments, so they carry external loads only via radial and axial reactions, with mounting configuration (direct/indirect, back-to-back/face-to-face) setting the positions of effective load-carrying centers and effective spread.

#### Page 42

Equations based on simple beam theory and superposition are given to resolve vertical and horizontal reactions at two bearings for a shaft loaded by gear tangential, separating, and thrust forces, an external radial load, and an external moment at arbitrary angles, yielding resultant radial reactions at A and B and axial reactions with the fixed end carrying thrust and the float end carrying none. The page advises matching bearing types to load support capabilities—tapered roller and ball bearings handle radial, moment, and bidirectional thrust; spherical rollers handle radial and bidirectional thrust but not moment; cylindrical rollers handle radial and moment with only slight thrust—and explains that shafts on three or more supports require computational solutions because deflections of the shaft, bearings, and housings determine load distribution.

#### Page 43

Dynamic equivalent radial load Pr is used for L10 life calculations and is generally Pr = XFr + YFa; for spherical roller bearings use Pr = Fr + YFa when Fa/Fr ≤ e and Pr = 0.67Fr + YFa when Fa/Fr > e, with e and Y taken from the Timken catalog. For cylindrical roller bearings Pr = Fr under purely radial load (with dynamic radial load recommended < C/3 and axial load considered if Fa < allowable Faz per Table 4 series-dependent equations), while for radial and angular contact ball bearings Table 5 provides contact-angle- and mounting-specific formulas using Y factors from Table 6, with a note to consult Timken if Pr exceeds Co or 1/2 CE.

#### Page 44

Table 6 provides required Y factors (Y, Y2, Y3) for calculating ball bearing dynamic equivalent radial loads across various KT values. In tapered roller bearings, radial loads induce thrust that must be opposed to prevent ring separation (the seated bearing sees the opposing bearing’s induced thrust plus any external thrust, while the unseated sees only its own), with a 180-degree load zone assumed under pure radial load yielding Fa(180)=0.47 Fr K and C90 defined at this condition; when applied thrust exceeds the induced thrust, use dynamic equivalent radial loads approximated by equations in Tables 7 and 8 based on 180 degrees in one bearing and 180 degrees or more in the other.

#### Page 45

For single-row tapered roller bearing mountings, determine whether bearings are direct or indirect mounted and which bearing (A or B) receives the external thrust Fae, then use the corresponding case in Table 7 to select the axial load (FaA, FaB) and dynamic equivalent radial load (PA, PB) equations. The equations relate FrA, FrB, Fae, and factors KA and KB, with typical forms PA = FrA or 0.4 FrA + KA FaA and PB = FrB or 0.4 FrB + KB FaB, using 0.47 Fr thresholds to establish thrust direction and including the rule that PA and PB must not be less than FrA and FrB, respectively.

#### Page 46

Dynamic equivalent radial load equations are provided for double-row tapered roller bearing mountings (fixed or floating) in similar and dissimilar bearing series, with only bearing A carrying the applied thrust load in the table (swap A/B if thrust is on B). With no external thrust (Fae = 0), Pr equals FrAB or Frc and life is calculated using the double-row rating C90(2); when thrust is present, use the tabulated expressions (with KA, KB and Fae relative to K) to determine PA and PB, note that FrAB is the radial load on the double-row assembly, and apply the single-row rating C90 for life.

#### Page 47

Guidelines are given to calculate dynamic equivalent thrust loads: if Fr=0 then Pa=Fa for thrust ball, spherical, and tapered roller bearings (otherwise consult a Timken engineer), Pa for thrust angular contact ball bearings is determined using catalog X and Y factors and minimum Fa/Fr ratios, and for thrust spherical roller bearings Pa=1.2Fr+Fa with Fr≤0.55Fa and an induced thrust Fai=1.2Fr that must be resisted by opposing thrust capacity. Static equivalents are defined with contact stress approximations, using Por=XoFr+YoFa for spherical roller, radial ball, and angular contact ball bearings (Xo, Yo in Table 9), Poa=XoFr+YoFa for thrust ball bearings, and Poa=Fa+2.7Fr for thrust spherical roller bearings which require a minimum thrust load and Poa≤0.5Coa (consult Timken if exceeded).

#### Page 48

For single-row tapered roller bearings, determine the thrust load Fa and then use the provided conditional equations (with external axial load Fae where applicable) to compute static equivalent radial loads P0A and P0B based on whether FaA or FaB is below or above 0.6 Fr/KA or 0.6 Fr/KB, and compare P0 to the static rating C0 even if P0 is less than Fr; for double-row bearings, estimate the static radial rating as C0(2) = 2C0. To prevent slippage, the minimum load for radial cylindrical and spherical roller bearings is Pr = 0.04 C, while thrust spherical roller bearings require an induced thrust Fac = k n^2 × 10^-5 and a minimum working thrust Fa min = 1.2 Fr + Fac, which should be at least 0.1% of the static thrust rating C0a.

#### Page 49

There are two fundamental bearing load ratings: dynamic, used to estimate the life of a rotating bearing (Timken publishes C for 1 million L10 revolutions and, for tapered roller bearings, C90 and Ca90 for radial and thrust loads at 90 million L10 revolutions), and static, used to determine the maximum permissible load on a non-rotating bearing; dynamic ratings depend on internal geometry and material cleanliness. Static ratings are based on maximum contact stresses of 4000 MPa (roller) and 4200 MPa (ball) at the most heavily loaded contact, stress levels that may leave light Brinell marks without measurably affecting fatigue life under lower subsequent loads, but lower limits should be applied when sound, vibration, torque, or shock are critical and selection should be made with a Timken engineer.

#### Page 50

Bearing life, defined as the time or revolutions until a 6 mm² fatigue spall occurs, is a statistical quantity predicted for populations using the Weibull distribution, with rating life L10 denoting the life that 90% of identical bearings meet or exceed; traditional L10 equations use dynamic load rating (C or Ca), dynamic equivalent load (Pr or Pa), speed n, and exponent e=3 for ball bearings or e=10/3 for tapered, cylindrical, and spherical roller bearings to express life in revolutions or hours. Tapered roller bearings may use ratings based on 90 million cycles, and Bearing Systems Analysis expands the traditional approach with adjustment factors, as in the ABMA equation Lna=a1a2a3L10 and Timken’s expanded equation with additional application-related factors, to better reflect actual operating conditions.

#### Page 51

Reliability life is defined as the probability a bearing reaches a specified life, and a reliability adjustment factor a1 (tabulated, e.g., 1.00 at 90% and 0.25 at 99%) is used to modify L10 life, though this adjustment may be inaccurate at very high reliability and warrants consultation. The material factor a2 is 1.0 for standard bearing-quality steel (premium low-inclusion steels can extend life when fatigue is inclusion-limited, contact stresses are approximately less than 2400 MPa/350 ksi, and lubrication is adequate—material improvements cannot offset poor lubrication), while debris-induced denting reduces life relative to a 40 μm filtration/ISO ~15/12 baseline, so cleanliness-based adjustments or a Debris Signature Analysis can quantify the impact of different debris types (hard ductile particles being most detrimental) and inform debris-resistant solutions.

#### Page 52

Bearing fatigue life depends on rolling element/raceway stresses and stress cycles governed by the load zone; reducing internal clearance (neglecting preload) enlarges the load zone and increases life, and the dynamic equivalent load Pr replaces Fr to approximate its effect on L10a, with detailed assessments requiring Timken consultation. The lubrication life factor a3l—based chiefly on surface finish relative to lubricant film thickness and a catalog-listed geometry factor Cg (which includes material and load-zone design effects for non-tapered bearings but is not applicable to DuraSpexx)—is limited to a maximum of 2.88 with minimums of 0.200 for case-carburized and 0.126 for through-hardened bearings, and excludes contamination effects because tests assume 40 um filtration.

#### Page 53

The load factor (Cl) is taken from Fig. 70 and depends on bearing type (ball vs. roller) and the dynamic equivalent bearing load Pr (in Newtons), which is obtained from the Dynamic Equivalent Bearing Loads (Pr) section. The load zone factor (Cj) is 1 for non-tapered roller bearings, and for tapered roller bearings it is read from Fig. 71 as a function of Fr/(Fa·K).

#### Page 54

The speed factor (Cs) is determined from a chart correlating the inner ring’s rotational speed (RPM) relative to the outer ring with Cs for ball and roller bearings. The viscosity factor (Cv) is obtained by estimating the lubricant’s kinematic viscosity at the bearing’s operating temperature (using a temperature–viscosity chart with ISO VG references) and then reading Cv from charts of Cv versus kinematic viscosity (cSt) for ball and roller bearings.

#### Page 55

Grease degradation reduces lubricant film thickness over time, so a grease lubrication reduction factor Cgr = 0.79 should be applied to adjust bearing life calculations. A low-load life factor a3p, derived from tests and modeling, predicts increased fatigue life under low contact stresses with sufficient film and is presented as a function of lubricant life factor a3l and the ratio of bearing dynamic rating to bearing equivalent load (Fig. 75).

#### Page 56

Accurate shaft-to-housing alignment is critical; misalignment under moderate to heavy loads produces edge contact stresses that special raceway/roller profiling can greatly reduce, improving bearing life, with tapered roller ratings referenced to 0.0005 rad misalignment and cylindrical roller misalignment factors also capturing axial load effects that shift contact to roller ends. For cylindrical rollers with profiled rollers the maximum recommended misalignment is 1.2 mrad (0.07°) at <20% C, 0.5 mrad (0.03°) at 20–35% C and for >35% C consult your Timken engineer, while spherical roller bearings have a misalignment factor of 1.0 and allowable misalignment of ±0.5° (series 238), ±0.75° (222, 230, 231, 239, 249), ±1° (223, 240), or ±1.25° (232, 241), with life reduced if these limits are exceeded.

#### Page 57

System reliability—the probability that all bearings meet the required life—is the product of individual bearing reliabilities, and the system L10 life for bearings with different L10 values is L10(system) = [(1/L10A)^(3/2) + ... + (1/L10n)^(3/2)]^(-2/3). For variable load/speed duty cycles, selection can use a weighted average load (Fwt = [(n1 t1 F1^(10/3) + ... + nn tn Fn^(10/3))/na]^0.3, or for uniformly increasing load at constant speed Fwt = [(3/13)(Fmax^(13/3) - Fmin^(13/3))/(Fmax - Fmin)]^0.3) while still checking extreme conditions for stresses and alignment; because differing speeds affect the lubrication factor a3l, life should be computed for each condition and combined with the weighted average life Lnwt = 1/{[t1/(Ln)1] + [t2/(Ln)2] + ... + [tn/(Ln)n]}.

#### Page 58

Ball and roller bearings have tolerance classes for bore, O.D., width, and runout, with inch bearings historically using positive bore/O.D. tolerances and metric bearings using corresponding standard negative tolerances. The page summarizes ISO/DIN classes P0–P2 for ball, cylindrical, and spherical bearings, ABMA ABEC/RBEC classes 1–9, and Timken/ABMA tapered roller classes (metric K–A/AA, inch 4–000), and notes boundary dimension tolerances to guide general bearing selection and mounting.

#### Page 59

Timken radial ball, spherical roller and cylindrical roller bearings follow ISO 492 normal tolerances, with P6 or P5 recommended when running accuracy is critical; deviation is the difference between a single ring dimension and the nominal dimension (nominal at +0 mm) expressed as the tolerance range, while variation is the difference between the largest and smallest measurements of a parameter on an individual ring. Table 15 lists metric inner ring tolerances by bore size for classes P0, P6 and P5—covering bore deviation, width variation, radial runout, face runout with bore, axial runout, and inner/outer ring width deviation—with tighter limits for higher precision classes and generally larger absolute tolerances for larger bores, and with tolerance ranges taken from +0 to the listed values.

#### Page 60

Table 16 specifies metric outer ring tolerances for radial ball, spherical, and cylindrical roller bearings across outside diameter ranges, listing permissible outside diameter deviations (4Dmp), width variation (VCS/CS), radial runout (Kea), axial runout (Se), and outside diameter runout with face for tolerance classes P0, P6, and P5, with values shown in millimeters and inches and a note that the tolerance range is from +0 to the listed value. Table 17 summarizes thrust ball bearing (Type TVB) tolerances for bore, outside diameter, and height, with bore and O.D. tolerance ranges, and states that these tolerances conform to ABMA Standard 21.2.

#### Page 61

Metric and inch-system tolerances for thrust ball bearings (Types TVL & DTVL) are listed, detailing bore, outer diameter, and height tolerances across size ranges along with radial runout limits, with values given in millimeters and inches and tolerance ranges defined from +0 to the listed values. The page also includes thrust spherical roller bearing tolerances with inner ring data and notes that all tolerances conform to ABMA Standard 21.2.

#### Page 62

Timken manufactures metric tapered roller bearings in six tolerance classes, with K and N as standard (N with tighter width tolerance) and C, B, A, AA as precision, generally within ISO 492 and with any small differences having insignificant effects on mounting and performance. Table 20 presents inner ring bore maximum/minimum tolerance limits across bore size ranges from 10 mm to 2000 mm for each class and notes that SR assemblies are made to class N only.

#### Page 63

Metric tolerances for the outer ring outside diameter of tapered roller bearings are tabulated across standard (K, N) and precision (B, A, AA) classes for bearing types TS, TSF, and SR, covering OD ranges from 10 mm to 2000 mm (with inch equivalents) and showing zero positive with increasingly negative limits as size grows. For each OD band, maximum/minimum deviations are specified for each class, precision classes have tighter limits than standard classes, some large sizes lack precision-class values (dashes), and SR assemblies are manufactured to class N only.

#### Page 64

Table 22 lists metric inner ring width tolerances for tapered roller bearings by bore diameter (with inch equivalents), covering standard and precision classes (K, N, B, A, AA) and bearing types TS and TSF. Across bore ranges from 10 mm up to 1600 mm, the maximum is 0.000 while minimum allowable inner ring widths span roughly -0.050 to -0.350 mm (e.g., -0.100 mm at 10–50 mm, -0.150 to -0.300 mm at 50–120 mm, and up to -0.350 mm for larger sizes), with dashes indicating non-specified values.

#### Page 65

Table 23 presents metric tolerances for the inner ring stand of tapered roller bearings (TS/TSF), showing permissible maximum and minimum dimensions in both millimeters and inches for standard and precision classes across bore sizes from 10 mm to 400 mm, with certain sizes produced only as matched assemblies. Inner ring stand is defined as the variation in inner ring raceway size, taper, and roller diameter, checked by measuring the axial location of a master outer ring or gauge reference surface relative to the inner ring reference face.

#### Page 66

Table 24 defines metric outer ring width tolerances for tapered roller bearings (TS, TSF) by O.D. range (10–1600 mm with inch equivalents), showing a 0.000 maximum and minimum limits that become more negative with size (about −0.100 to −0.400 mm) across standard (N, B) and precision (A, AA) classes, with some ranges not specified. A note states these tolerances differ slightly from ISO 492 but the differences are insignificant for mounting and performance, and 30000 series ISO bearings are available with the above parameter per ISO 492.

#### Page 67

The page provides metric tolerance specifications for the outer ring stand of tapered roller bearings (TS and TSF), listing allowable plus/minus limits across outer diameter ranges from 10 mm to 400 mm for standard and precision classes, with notes that certain sizes are manufactured only as matched assemblies. It defines outer ring stand as the variation in outer ring I.D. size and taper measured by the axial position of a master plug’s reference surface relative to the outer ring’s reference face, and specifies that for flanged outer rings the stand is measured from the flange backface (seating face).

#### Page 68

Tapered roller bearing overall width tolerances in the metric system are tabulated by bore range (10 mm to 1600 mm) with max/min limits in millimeters and inches for standard classes K and N and precision classes C, B, A, and AA. The table shows limited availability of precision classes at larger bores, and notes that TSF tolerances apply to dimension T1 while SR assemblies are manufactured to tolerance class N only.

#### Page 69

The table presents metric radial runout tolerances for tapered roller bearings across specified outer diameter ranges, with standard classes K and N and precision classes C, B, A, and AA, listing values from 0.018 to 0.200 mm (0.0007 to 0.0079 in) and showing that precision-class tolerances are not available at the largest sizes. Runout is defined as Total Indicator Reading of rotational accuracy that includes roundness and centering errors, and SR assemblies are manufactured to tolerance class N only.

#### Page 70

Inch-system tapered roller bearings conforming to ABMA 19.2 are categorized into standard classes 4 and 2 and precision classes 3, 0, 00, and 000, with tables detailing maximum and minimum inner ring bore and outer ring outside diameter tolerances for bearing types such as TS, TSF, TDI, TNA, TNASW/TNASWE, TSL, TDIT, and TDO over size ranges from 0 to 48 inches. A note clarifies that for TSL bearings the inner ring bore may be slightly reduced at the large end due to tight seal fit on the rib, which does not affect performance.

#### Page 71

In the inch system, tapered roller bearing tolerances are tabulated for the outer ring flange by outer diameter range, with maximum positive limits of +0.051 in (to 12 in O.D.), +0.076 in (12–24 in), +0.102 in (24–36 in), and +0.127 in (over 36 in), and minimums of 0.000 in across standard and precision classes. Inner ring width tolerance for TS, TSF, TSL, 2S, TDI, TDIT, and TDO types is +0.0030/−0.0100 in for all sizes, while outer ring width tolerance for all types is generally +0.0020/−0.0100 in, with larger sizes allowing up to about +0.0050 in positive tolerance.

#### Page 72

Tables 33 and 34 present inch-system max/min tolerances for tapered roller bearing inner and outer ring stand across standard and precision classes and multiple bearing types (e.g., TS, TSF, TSL, TDI, TDIT, TDO, 2S), organized by bore ranges from 0–101.600 mm (0–4.0000 in) up to 406.400 mm (16.0000 in). Inner ring stand measures variation in inner ring raceway size, taper, and roller diameter and is checked with master gauges relative to the inner ring face (outer ring stand measures outer ring I.D. size and taper and is checked relative to the outer ring face or flange backface), with notes that some sizes are manufactured only as matched assemblies and that class 2 TDI/TDIT bearings with 101.600–304.800 mm (4.0000–12.0000 in) bores have an inner ring stand of ±0.102 mm (±0.0040 in).

#### Page 73

A table presents inch-system radial runout tolerances (T.I.R.) for tapered roller bearing types TS/TSF/TSL, 2S/TDI, TDIT/TDO/TNA, and TNASW/TNASWE across outside diameter ranges from 0–10.5 in, 10.5–12 in, 12–24 in, and 24–36 in, with specified limits for standard classes and, where available, finer limits for precision classes (0, 00, 000) ranging approximately from 0.0020 in up to 0.0030 in. Runout is defined as the total indicator reading of rotational accuracy measured as total displacement, and radial runout includes both roundness errors and the centering error of the sensed surface.

#### Page 74

Table 36 lists overall bearing width tolerances (inch system) for tapered roller bearings, showing maximum and minimum deviations by standard and precision classes across specified bore and O.D. ranges for types including TDI, TDIT, TDO, TS, TSF, TSL, TNA, TNASW, and TNASWE. It provides allowable plus/minus limits (e.g., ±0.0150, ±0.0160, ±0.0300 inches, sometimes asymmetric or zero) and notes that for TSF the tolerance applies to dimension T1 as referenced in the Timken Tapered Roller Bearing Catalog.

#### Page 75

Tables 37–39 present inch-system Class 4 tolerances for thrust tapered roller bearings (TTHD, TTHDFL, TTVS, TTC, TTSP), detailing permissible deviations for bore, outside diameter, and width by specified size ranges. For each range, maximum and minimum limits are given for Precision 2 and Precision 3 (and width deviation for Precision 4), covering bore sizes from 0 to 48.0000 in, outside diameters from 0 to 36.0000 in, and width ranges up to 5.0000 in or all sizes for TTC/TTSP, with values shown in both millimeters and inches.

#### Page 76

All bearing types are mounted on shafts and in housings with backing shoulders that set axial location and alignment; designs include machined shoulders and snap rings with optional spacers (including split spacers), shoulders must be square, adequately sized and wear-resistant, and surface finishes should be Ra ≤1.6 µm for roller-bearing shaft seats, Ra ≤0.8 µm for ball-bearing seats on shafts <2 in (≤1.6 µm otherwise), and Ra ≤3.2 µm for turned shaft seats (using a tighter heavy-duty fit) and housing bores. Ensure proper installation and lubrication and never spin a bearing with compressed air to avoid serious injury from expelled rollers.

#### Page 77

Bearing rings on rotating members should use interference fits, since loose fits can cause creep, wear, and damage, and fit selection depends on precision class, ring rotation, bearing layout, load type/direction, running conditions (shock, vibration, overload, high speed), machining capability, component sections/materials, and mounting/setting conditions. Figure 78 presents an industry-standard guide to shaft and housing fit selection, mapping shaft/housing diameter and tolerance grades (e.g., g6, h6, k5, r7; F7, H7, K6, P6, etc.) to loose and tight (interference) fit ranges based on load and ring rotation conditions.

#### Page 78

A specified internal clearance—typically measured as radial internal clearance (RIC)—is used to compensate for interference fits and thermal effects and, for some bearing types, to establish the desired contact angle after mounting; tapered roller and angular contact bearings are set axially, and correct mounting and fitting practices are critical. Proper installation requires cleanliness (remove burrs/foreign material, clean shafts, housings, and blind holes; use air only on shafts/housings; shipping rust‑inhibitive oil need not be removed), appropriate tools without shocking rings, and for interference fits it is acceptable to heat or cool within limits (standard ≤120°C [250°F]/≥-55°C [-65°F]; precision ≤65°C [150°F]/≥-30°C [-20°F]) or press with an arbor press.

#### Page 79

Tapered roller bearings carry radial and thrust loads but create axial force under radial loading, so they are usually adjusted against a second bearing and mounted either directly by adjusting the outer ring via an outer-ring follower or carrier, or indirectly by clamping one inner ring with devices such as locknuts, stakenuts, end plates, or a precision nut. General fitting practice tables applicable to solid or heavy-sectioned steel shafts, heavy-sectioned ferrous housings, and normal operating conditions begin on page 154 and require identifying whether the member rotates, the loading magnitude, direction and type, and the shaft finish, and backing shoulder diameters are listed in the Timken Tapered Roller Bearing Catalog on www.timken.com.

#### Page 80

Special applications may require deviating from table fits, but as a rule rotating inner rings use interference fits (loose fits only if proven, to avoid creep and wear), while stationary inner ring fits vary with conditions—interference for high speed/heavy/shock, near-zero on unground shafts at moderate duty, minimal to bore-size-dependent looseness for sheaves/wheels, slightly looser on hardened/ground spindles, with special fits for multiple-sheave blocks. For outer rings, those rotating relative to the load always use interference and stationary/fixed single-row types should be tight where practical (adjustable fits only for axial setup, but tight in heavy-duty/high-load, in carriers, and whenever the load rotates); use the same adjustable fit at both shaft ends for through-bored equal ODs unless backed by snap rings (then tight fits and only rings needing ≤1.3 mm fillet), while double-row stationary double outer rings are generally loose to allow assembly and float; tables cover inch classes 4, 2, 3, 0, 00 and metric classes K, N, C, B, A, and precision-class bearings require similarly finished shafts and housings.

#### Page 81

Interference fits expand the inner ring and contract the outer ring, reducing internal clearance and increasing bearing width (the clearance change approximately equals the width change), so matched assemblies with preset bench endplay, SET-RIGHT statistical assemblies, and outer-ring-adjusted direct mounts using shims must compensate for fit effects to achieve the desired mounted setting. Formulas are given to calculate setting reduction/width increase for solid steel shafts/heavy-section housings and for thin-walled/light-section steel members (where the effect is smaller), recommended surface finishes are referenced, and non-steel materials require consulting Timken.

#### Page 82

Tapered roller bearing setting—the axial clearance between rollers and raceways—is adjusted by axially moving one ring relative to the other to obtain endplay (EP), preload (PL), or line-to-line, with optimum bearing life generally achieved at a near-zero operating setting and most assemblies set with endplay to reach this in service. Because operating setting differs from ambient (assembly) setting due to thermal expansion, fits, geometry, size, materials, and load-induced deflection, use Operating setting = mounted setting + temperature effect + deflection (standard mounting), or for pre-set assemblies: Mounted EP/PL = bench EP/PL − effect of fits, then Operating setting = mounted EP/PL + deflection ± temperature effect.

#### Page 83

This page presents equations to determine tapered roller bearing setting changes from fit and temperature effects—covering setting reduction/width increase for inner and outer rings in solid/heavy and hollow/thin-wall configurations and direct versus indirect mounting—applicable only to ferrous shafts and housings. It specifies that assembly setting limits should reflect application type, duty cycle/loading, adjacent drive element behavior, thermal and deflection effects, bearing size and setting method, lubrication, and shaft/housing material, and recommends accounting for operational changes or consulting a Timken engineer when experience is limited.

#### Page 84

Spherical and cylindrical roller bearings are often mounted in combination, typically with one bearing fixed axially and the other with loose fits and axial space to allow float for uneven thermal growth, as shown in applications like gearboxes using two spherical bearings (one floating), pulverizer wheels pairing a double-row spherical with a cylindrical bearing (for shaft float), and gear reducers combining tapered and cylindrical bearings. Recommended fitting practices (per ISO 286 symbols) assume normal-precision bearings, thick steel or cast iron housings, solid steel shafts, and bearing seats finished to <1.6 µm Ra, and generally call for interference fits on rotating inner rings to prevent creep, wear, looseness, and contamination-induced damage and vibration.

#### Page 85

Select shaft and housing fits based on load and rotation (interference for rotating rings, loose for stationary outer rings to permit assembly/float), use tighter press fits for thin-walled/alloy/hollow or rough surfaces, and consider tapered-bore designs with adapter sleeves or tapered shafts driven by locknuts, with axial drive-up causing about 85% radial clearance loss (~71 um/mm for 1:12, ~28 um/mm for 1:30). Interference fits and thermal gradients reduce radial internal clearance (≈80% from inner-ring-to-shaft, ≈60% from outer-ring-to-housing), so choose ISO 5753 classes C2–C5 (most use C0 or C3) and increase clearance for speeds above ~70% of rating, noting that larger clearance narrows the load zone and can shorten life while preload should be avoided due to heat and fatigue.

#### Page 86

Table 40 lists radial internal clearance limits prior to mounting for spherical roller bearings with cylindrical bores, providing minimum and maximum values for clearance classes C2, Normal (C0), C3, C4, and C5 across nominal bore ranges from 20 mm to 630 mm with inch equivalents. The tabulated data shows increasing allowable clearances with larger bore sizes, with each range given in both millimeters and inches.

#### Page 87

Data tables list radial internal clearance prior to mounting for spherical and cylindrical roller bearings across bore ranges 630–1250 mm (with inch equivalents), showing min/max values for clearance classes Normal (C0), C2, C3, C4, and C5. A separate table (Table 41) provides spherical roller bearing endplay by series along with corresponding RIC values (e.g., series 39: 8.7, 30: 7.0, 22: 5.5, 31: 5.0, 40: 4.8, 32: 4.4, 23: 4.3, 41: 4.2, 33: 3.9).

Table 42 presents radial internal clearance limits for spherical roller bearings with tapered bores, detailing pre-mounting clearances, suggested reduction during installation, required axial inner-ring displacement on tapered shafts, and minimum permissible clearance after installation, with values in millimeters and inches for C0, C3, and C4. It provides detailed ranges for nominal bores from 20 mm to 400 mm, including corresponding axial displacement and RIC limits across bore intervals and references to 1:12 and 1:30 taper ratios.

A table provides radial internal clearance (RIC) and installation parameters for spherical and cylindrical roller bearings across bore ranges from 400 to 1250 mm, including RIC prior to mounting, suggested RIC reduction during installation, axial inner-ring displacement on tapered shafts, and minimum permissible RIC after installation, with values in both metric and inches for clearance classes such as C0, C3, and C4. Notes specify that axial displacement values assume solid steel shafts (or hollow shafts with bores under half the shaft diameter), are measured from a line-to-line fit for tapered bore bearings, use 1:12 taper for series 213/222/223/230/231/232/233/238/239 and 1:30 for 240/241/242, apply sleeve-mount multipliers of 1.1 (1:12) and 1.05 (1:30), and recommend consulting a Timken sales engineer for non-steel or thin-walled shafts and tapered shaft data.

Table 43 presents radial internal clearance limits (minimum and maximum) for cylindrical roller bearings with cylindrical bores, arranged by nominal bore ranges from 10 mm (0.3937 in.) up to 1000 mm (39.3701 in.) and by clearance classes C2, C0, C3, C4, and C5. The table provides metric and inch values for each class and bore range, showing progressively larger clearances with increasing bore size and higher clearance classes.

#### Page 91

A step-by-step procedure outlines measuring and setting radial internal clearance (RIC) for a spherical roller bearing with a tapered bore by seating the rollers, measuring unmounted RIC at the unloaded roller with a feeler gauge, confirming specification, determining the suggested RIC reduction, calculating the target mounted RIC, and correlating this to required inner-ring axial displacement while mounting with a locknut or hydraulic nut. In the example of a 22328KEJW33C3 (140 mm bore), an unmounted RIC of 0.178 mm (within 0.160–0.200 mm) yields a target mounted RIC of 0.089–0.114 mm after a 0.064–0.089 mm reduction, requires 0.890–1.270 mm axial displacement on a 1:12 taper, and must remain above the 0.075 mm minimum permissible RIC.

#### Page 92

A step-by-step example for bearing 22230EMW33 calculates the load/rating ratio P=0.09 and selects ISO fits p6 for the rotating inner ring and H8 for the outer ring in a solid housing to support RIC reduction. Applying these fits yields shaft diameters of 150.043–150.068 mm and housing bores of 270.000–270.081 mm, resulting in tight shaft interference of -0.093 to -0.043 mm and loose housing interference of 0.000 to +0.116 mm.

#### Page 93

The procedure calculates radial internal clearance (RIC) by applying fit-induced reductions (about 80% for tight shaft fits and 60% for tight housing fits, with no reduction for loose fits), then uses Table 40 to get unmounted RIC, computes mounted RIC, and compares it to minimum permissible values. In the 22230EMW33 example, C0 clearance yields a mounted RIC of 0.036–0.136 mm versus a minimum permissible 0.056 mm, prompting a switch to C3 (mounted RIC 0.096–0.186 mm), which is further confirmed acceptable since the 1,200 rpm operating speed is below 70% of the 2,000 rpm thermal reference speed.

#### Page 94

Installation with tight-fit inner rings demands a clean, planned setup with all components cleaned and inspected, shaft shoulders and spacers square, fillets sized to clear bearing radii, and bearing seats finished to about 1.6 µm Ra on rotating shafts (or 3.2 µm Ra with slightly more interference) and housing bores to 3.2 µm Ra, keeping the bearing wrapped until mounting. Cylindrical-bore bearings are mounted by heat expansion using an oil bath (typically 93°C, not exceeding 121°C) or induction heating (≤93°C), then seating hot against the shaft shoulder and securing with lock hardware tightened as it cools; to avoid overheating keep the bearing off direct heat with screens and blocks, monitor with thermal crayons, heat the housing if the outer ring is tight, and where open oil baths are prohibited use a 15% soluble-oil water mix up to 93°C.

#### Page 95

For smaller bearings, use an arbor press with a clean, soft-steel mounting tube—ID slightly larger than the shaft and OD not exceeding the shaft backing diameter for shaft fits, or for housing fits OD slightly smaller than the housing bore and ID not less than the suggested housing backing diameter—to press the bearing squarely into place on a lightly oiled shaft with steady pressure, and never press through the wrong ring, clean with steam/hot water, expose to flame, or heat beyond 149°C (300°F). Tapered bore spherical roller bearings are mounted by measuring radial internal clearance (RIC) with a feeler gauge across correctly positioned top rollers to establish the pre-installation value, then lubricating the tapered shaft, sliding the bearing on, tightening the locknut to build interference while periodically checking RIC reduction at the unloaded roller until the specified reduction is achieved (without exceeding it), confirming the remaining RIC meets the minimum mounted clearance, and securing the lockwasher tang or lockplate.

#### Page 96

For small cylindrical-bore bearings, use an arbor press with a clean, square-faced soft-steel mounting tube (ID slightly larger than the shaft; OD within specified backing diameter or slightly smaller than the housing bore), lightly oil the shaft, align the bearing square, and apply steady ram pressure, never pressing on the outer ring for shaft fits or on the inner ring for housing fits. Tapered-bore spherical roller bearings are mounted by first measuring RIC before installation with progressively thicker feeler gage blades at the top roller, lubricating the tapered shaft, tightening the locknut to build the interference fit while periodically tracking RIC reduction until the proper amount is achieved and the remaining RIC meets the minimum mounted clearance, ensuring the unloaded roller is seated, then peening the lockwasher tang or securing the lockplate.

#### Page 97

Angular contact ball bearings transmit loads along a contact angle that creates radial and axial components, so axial forces are counteracted by mounting bearings in pairs with preload, while single bearings require careful axial adjustment using preloaded springs or shims to seat the races correctly. Duplex units can be mounted back-to-back, face-to-face, or in tandem for higher thrust capacity and may use spacers to increase spread and reduce shaft deflection, with performance relying on accurately ground spacers and precise fits, shoulder squareness, and alignment, and they are used in deep well pumps, marine propeller shafts, machine tool spindles, speed reducers, and elevator worm drives.

#### Page 98

Back-to-back (DB/O) duplex angular contact ball bearings, with contact angles diverging toward the shaft centerline, have pre-mount clearance between adjacent inner-ring faces and develop internal preload when these faces are clamped together, providing axial and radial rigidity, equal thrust capacity in either direction, and suitability for pulleys, sheaves, overturning loads, and floating positions with shaft thermal expansion; it is the most commonly used duplex arrangement. Face-to-face (DF/X) mountings, with contact angles converging toward the shaft centerline, have pre-mount clearance between adjacent outer-ring faces and develop preload when clamped between housing and cover-plate shoulders, offering bidirectional thrust and rigidity but suffering from low resistance to moment loading and thermal instability, so they should be used only when they significantly simplify assembly or disassembly.

#### Page 99

In tandem (DT) mounting of angular contact ball bearings, the inner- and outer-ring faces are not flush before mounting but align on both sides under an axial load equal to twice the normal preload, providing double thrust capacity in one direction; additional bearings may be added in tandem, with one marked and one unmarked outer-ring face together, to further increase thrust capacity. Flush-ground (DU) pairs can be combined with a single flush-ground bearing as a triplex (TU) set, or three bearings in tandem can be mounted back-to-back with a single bearing as a quadruplex (QU) set, both offering high one-directional capacity and a positively rigid mounting capable of carrying moderate reverse thrust.

#### Page 100

Use the shaft fits in table 72 for 7000WN, 7200WU, 7300WN, and 7400WN when only one ring has an interference fit; if both rings are interference-fitted, special internal clearance may be needed, shaft diameters are for solid steel shafts, and a Timken engineer should be consulted for special or hollow-shaft fits. For duplex bearings, standard and special preload levels are available; heavier preload improves rigidity but reduces life and increases power consumption, axial deflection under thrust is non-linear with preloaded double-row/back-to-back arrangements exhibiting much lower deflection than unpreloaded bearings, and preload may be applied by springs or spacer width adjustment subject to design review.

#### Page 101

Radial ball bearing tolerance standards are shifting from ABEC/ABMA to ISO, aligning ISO P0 (ABEC 1) with standard use and ISO P6 (ABEC 3) and higher classes with increased precision, with only P0/ABEC 1 and P6/ABEC 3 covered in this section and higher classes deferred to the Precision Bearings section. Mounting options and applications are outlined—including suitability for combined radial/thrust loads and high speeds, Conrad and filling-slot types, and fixed versus floating designs—along with shaft and housing shoulder backing diameter recommendations, exemplified by Table 45 for the extra-light 9300 series.

#### Page 102

Radial ball bearings should be located using accurate shoulders perpendicular to the shaft axis that are sized to exceed the corner-radius tangency while still allowing removal, and specified fillet radii from product dimensional tables must be used to ensure proper seating against shaft and housing shoulders. Table 46 lists the suggested maximum and minimum shoulder diameters in both millimeters and inches for the extra-small series (S shaft, Hs housing) across basic bearing numbers (e.g., 33K3 through S12K), with advice to consult a Timken engineer if design limitations preclude following these recommendations.

#### Page 103

Table 47 provides recommended shoulder diameters for shafts (S) and housings (Hs), with minimum and maximum values in both millimeters and inches, for radial ball bearings in the Extra-Light 9100 series, Light 200/5200/7200WN series, and Medium 300/5300/7300WN series. It lists specific ranges for each basic bearing number (e.g., 9100–9122, 200–221, 300–321) to guide mounting design and fitting practice, with the table continued on the next page.

#### Page 104

A tabulated set of shoulder diameter specifications for radial ball bearings is provided for extra-light (9100), light (200, 5200, 7200WN), and medium (300, 5300, 7300WN) series. For each basic bearing number (e.g., 9124, 9126, 9128, 9130, 9132, 9134, 9138, 9140, 9144, 9148, 9152, 9156, 9160, 9164, 9180 and corresponding 200/300-series numbers), it lists S (shaft) and Hs (housing) shoulder maximum and minimum diameters in millimeters and inches.

#### Page 105

Table 48 specifies shaft shoulder (S) and housing shoulder (Hs) diameters—minimum and maximum values in millimeters and inches—for heavy radial ball bearings in the 400 and 7400 series and for non-standard extra-large sizes (Fig. 109). It lists basic bearing numbers (e.g., 7405–7420, 120W2, 122W, 124W, 224W, 276-2) with corresponding ranges, from smaller sizes like 7405 (S 34.0–37.3 mm, Hs 66.8–71.1 mm) to very large sizes like 276-2 (S about 400 mm, Hs up to about 463–464 mm).

#### Page 106

Housing shoulder diameters for radial ball bearings with Mechani-Seals are slightly modified to provide clearance between the seal’s external rotating member and the housing shoulder. Table 49 lists, by basic bearing number, the maximum and minimum diameter values in mm and inches for shaft and housing shoulders (Hs) for Mechani‑Seal KL, KLD, and KLL types.

#### Page 107

Wide inner ring ball bearings use a locking collar and are recommended to have a slip fit; inner ring bore tolerances are nominal to +0.013 mm (+0.0005 in.) for 1/2 to 2 3/16 in., +0.015 mm (+0.0006 in.) for 2 1/4 to 3 3/16 in., and +0.018 mm (+0.0007 in.) for 3 7/16 to 3 15/16 in., while shaft tolerances are nominal to -0.013 mm (-0.0005 in.) for 1/2 to 1 15/16 in. and -0.025 mm (-0.0010 in.) for 2 to 3 15/16 in., with increased shaft tolerances sometimes permissible upon review. Table 50 supplies recommended housing bore dimensions (min., mean fit, loose, max.), stationary housing shoulder diameters (Hs), basic outer ring size (D), and compatible shaft sizes for various bearing numbers across KRR, G-KRR, RA-RR, GRA-RR, and GYA-RR series, noting certain GYA-RR types for non-relubricated applications (omit prefix g).

#### Page 108

Guidance is provided on fitting practice and bearing setting—clearance or interference within a mounted radial ball bearing—stating that internal clearance, initially built into bearings to absorb press fits and accommodate thermal effects or desired contact angle, is influenced by fit tightness and application factors (load, speed, position, installation method, materials, runout, thermal considerations, hoop stress, and component design), with Table 73 giving shaft/housing fit guidelines for ISO P0 (ABEC 1) and ISO P6 (ABEC 3) and tolerance references on pages 132–135. Radial internal clearance (RIC) is measured in the radial direction by moving the outer ring horizontally to determine total movement, is defined as the average outer ring raceway diameter minus the average inner-ring raceway diameter minus twice the ball diameter, and Timken clearance prefixes map to industry levels: H/2 (snug), R/0 (medium), P/3 (loose), J/4 (extra loose), and JJ/5 (extra-extra loose).

#### Page 109

Endplay (axial clearance) is an alternate, seldom-used method of assessing internal clearance by clamping one bearing ring, applying a reversing axial measuring load to the other ring, and taking the total axial movement as the endplay. When the inner and outer raceway curvatures are known, the free endplay can be calculated from no-load radial internal clearance via a formula in which the RIC² term is usually negligible, and the contact angle is related to internal clearance through a sine-inverse relationship that includes the ball diameter and curvature factors Ko and Ki.

#### Page 110

A table lists the minimum and maximum radial internal clearance acceptance limits in both millimeters and inches for Timken radial ball bearings across basic bore diameter ranges from 2.5 mm (0.0984 in) to 1060 mm (41.7323 in), covering clearance classes H(C2), R(C0), P(C3), J(C4), and JJ(C5). It notes that the standard RIC values are R(C0) and P(C3), with P(C3) recommended for bearing outside diameters over 52 mm (2.0472 in).

#### Page 111

Spindle accuracy with precision bearings depends on well-designed, accurately machined, and properly fitted mounting surfaces, with round seats and square abutments to the axis to minimize cumulative runout and maintain alignment under load; mounting designs are selected to balance stiffness, speed capability, and ease of assembly. Recommended housing practices include heat-treated cast iron or steel with bores ground and checked for roundness/taper, machining both bores in one casting, using steel sleeves for assembly or soft housings, square and true shoulders, adequate section near screw holes, thorough cleaning before assembly, and effective sealing via a labyrinth flinger/end cover (or flinger plus contact seal for slow speeds) with flingers machined concentric and tapered, a drip groove, about 1.600 mm axial clearance, ~0.089 mm first radial clearance per side, and inner radial clearances of 0.190–0.380 mm.

#### Page 112

Shafts for precision bearings should be hardened and ground steel (45–50 HRC), with backing shoulders and inner ring seats ground in a single operation to ensure true balance and running accuracy. Settings are established with a precision adjusting nut secured by locking devices (two opposed screws pinching the threads or a screw on a soft metal shoe), while accuracy and stability are enhanced by using ground spacers with a square-ground spindle shoulder and locking nut, employing a centerline spacer to adjust the initial setting, and grinding the seats, shoulders, and nut abutment face together to eliminate misalignment from thread clearance.

#### Page 113

Precision tapered roller bearings in spindles are mounted either in a three-support configuration for heavily loaded or long spindles or as a simple arrangement using two single-row bearings. The three-support box-type mounting fixes two nose bearings axially to take bidirectional axial loads and uses a floating rear bearing—either a tapered roller or cylindrical roller—to absorb thermal expansion, a setup suited to special heavy machines at low to medium speeds and long spindles, while the two-bearing arrangement’s evolution is driven by speed and lubrication requirements.

#### Page 114

A TS/TSF spindle arrangement supports the nose and rear with two single-row tapered roller bearings, providing a simple, easily machined design with optimal bearing spread determined by stiffness calculations and approximated as 2.5–3 times the spindle nose diameter to balance stiffness and thermal expansion. TSF flanged outer rings permit through-bore housing machining without backing shoulders, bearings are set with a ground spacer and precision nut, and lubrication options include radial oil inlets or high-speed grease, with enhanced oil-jet systems at the small end or at both ends for inlet and cooling.

#### Page 115

A typical spindle arrangement combines a rear-mounted Hydra-Rib bearing with a nose-mounted single-row TS, where the Hydra-Rib’s outer-ring rib promotes high-speed lubrication by centrifugal oil flow so a simple axial oil inlet above the cage at the small roller end suffices, while the TS uses oil jets at both roller ends for oil inlet and cooling. Replacing the TS with a TSMA in the same layout, still feeding the Hydra-Rib axially and the TSMA via end jets, provides optimum preload across the widest operating speed range.

#### Page 116

A typical mounting arrangement for Timken TXR (DO) crossed roller bearings uses oil circulation with a maintained oil level, though grease lubrication is possible with appropriate sealing. The housing bore (DH) and spigot diameter (DS) should be machined to the mean of suggested interference fits and preload is set by external segments beneath the top inner-ring clamping plate, with consultation of a Timken engineer recommended for further use details.

#### Page 117

Precision duplex ball bearing mounting configurations include back-to-back (DB)—inner-ring faces clamped after mounting to preload, yielding axial/radial rigidity, equal bidirectional axial capacity, suitability for overturning loads and shaft thermal expansion, and being the most common—and face-to-face (DF)—outer-ring faces clamped, also rigid and bidirectional but with poor moment resistance and thermal instability, used mainly for assembly convenience. Tandem (DT) mountings align ring faces under an axial load equal to twice the normal preload to provide double axial capacity in one direction, and combinations such as triplex (TU) and quadruplex (QU) offer high one-direction capacity with a rigid mounting capable of moderate reverse thrust.

#### Page 118

Because spindles and inner-ring spacers heat and expand faster than housings and outer-ring spacers, face-to-face (DF) duplex arrangements are least rigid and tend to build excessive preload as thermal gradients impose added axial load on the inner rings, whereas back-to-back (DB) mountings tend to relieve preload under the same expansion. Avoid DB-DB and DF-DF fixed mountings, which can drive bearings into harmful preload cycles and lubricant breakdown, and instead use two tandem pairs arranged back-to-back (DT-DB) so lateral shaft expansion neither increases axial loading nor preload.

#### Page 119

Spring-loaded bearing mountings for high-speed spindles apply a predetermined axial load to maintain radial/axial rigidity and smooth performance while allowing lateral float during temperature changes; as the inner ring expands, the preload springs deflect to keep load consistent, using either single bearings or tandem pairs in back-to-back (DT-DB) arrangements with spring pressure at the rear to place the shaft in tension. For maximum precision, align the marked high points of runout on inner and outer rings (and set them 180° opposite the spindle and housing high points to cancel eccentricity), and further reduce runout by grinding the spindle nose after installation.

#### Page 120

Tapered roller bearings can be set during installation (or in service with a Hydra-Rib) irrespective of inner- and outer-ring fits, allowing wide machining tolerances, but fit selection should reflect precision class, layout, loads, operating conditions, component sections/materials, and mounting/setting method; precision-class bearings require similarly finished seats, simple machine-tool layouts typically tight-fit both rings to eliminate radial clearance, and special fits or expert guidance may be needed for light sections, non-steel shafts, nonferrous housings, high speed, unusual thermal/loading, or assembly constraints. For aluminum or magnesium housings, prevent metal pickup by freezing the outer ring and/or heating the housing and using a lubricant, consider steel inserts to use table fits, and if fitting directly into the housing apply minimum tight fits of 1.0 um per mm (0.0010 in. per in.) of outer ring outside diameter for aluminum and 1.5 um per mm (0.0015 in. per in.) for magnesium.

#### Page 121

Machining for tapered roller bearing seats must control circularity, cylindricity (including taper), coaxiality, and angularity, while shoulders require perpendicularity and flatness verified via total runout (including adjusting nut faces), with tolerances dependent on bearing class, size, and application and generally not exceeding the assembled bearing’s T.I.R.; users may measure a subset (e.g., roundness and taper) based on application needs and machining process confidence. Precision bearings require shaft and housing finishes at least as precise as the bearing bore/OD, with high-quality surface finishes per suggested values—shaft Ra about 0.8–0.2 μm (32–8 μin) and housing Ra about 1.6–0.4 μm (63–16 μin)—depending on bearing class.

#### Page 122

The shaft fit must secure the inner ring to prevent creep without excessive interference that expands the ring and increases preload and heat; for super precision ball bearings the shaft size and tolerance should match the bearing bore, with line-to-line fits for preloaded pairs (e.g., 0.010 mm interference can raise preload from 16 kg to ~86 kg). The outer ring is generally mounted with a hand push/light tapping and housing bore tolerances should match bearing O.D. tolerances, with careful adherence to tabulated tolerances, square relieved shoulders, and slightly looser housing fits when axial float is needed to accommodate thermal expansion or spring loading.

#### Page 123

Shaft geometry requirements for precision ball bearings specify roundness (t1), parallelism (t2), squareness (t3), concentricity (t4), and surface finish Ra, with MV ABEC 7 (ISO P4) requiring IT2 for t1–t3 and IT3 for t4, MMV/MM ABEC 7/9 (ISO P4S) requiring IT1 for t1–t3 and IT2 for t4, and MMX ABEC 9 (ISO P2) requiring IT0 for t1–t3 and IT2 for t4; surface finish is Ra 16 µin (0.4 µm) for all. A table provides ISO 286 IT-grade tolerances (IT0–IT3) in micrometers versus shaft journal diameter dso, e.g., at ≤10 mm: 0.6/1.0/1.5/2.5 µm and at >10–18 mm: 0.8/1.2/2.0/3.0 µm, with values increasing for larger diameters and microinch units also noted.

#### Page 124

Housing geometry requirements for precision ball bearings are defined, specifying roundness (t1), parallelism (t2), and squareness (t3) tolerances as IT2 for MV ABEC 7 (ISO P4), IT1 for MMV/MM ABEC 7/9 (ISO P4S), and IT0 for MMX ABEC 9 (ISO P2), with concentricity (t4) at IT3 for MV and IT2 for the higher classes, and a common surface finish of Ra 16 μin (0.4 μm). An ISO 286-based table lists the corresponding IT0–IT3 values in micrometers and microinches for housing journal diameters from 10 to 400 mm.

#### Page 125

Bearing operating setting strongly affects temperature, dynamic stiffness, accuracy/runout, and life, with slight preload generally optimal for TS/TSF bearings; determining the cold-mounted setting requires evaluating speed, loads, bearing configuration and spread, lubrication, and external heat sources, ideally confirmed by lab temperature measurements. Inner rings run hotter and create a typical 2 to 5°C shaft–housing gradient that alters setting, and while pure radial bearings cannot correct the proportional radial variation, tapered roller bearings can compensate via axial expansion and optimized spread, with a graphical method and a formula provided to calculate loss of endplay and centerline distances.

#### Page 126

During startup, radial thermal expansion precedes axial spindle expansion, temporarily reducing axial endplay and increasing preload; to avoid excessive preload and potential bearing damage, set a light cold endplay initially, adjust during testing, and estimate endplay loss using the standard formula with parameter L omitted. A three-support mounting, due to its shorter geometric spread at the fixed position, is more thermally sensitive than a two-support arrangement, leading to higher temperature rise and greater loss of endplay over time.

#### Page 127

Precision ball bearings are typically run with preload achieved by clamping to remove internal clearance, creating axial force and compressive raceway contact that increases stiffness and reduces axial and radial deflection under load. The optimum preload—chosen from light, medium, or heavy—must balance stiffness, speed capability, and life, since greater preload increases rigidity but narrows the speed range due to heating and, while life may initially improve, heavy preload causes life to drop, as shown by deflection trends with higher preload.

#### Page 128

Guidelines specify shaft fit tolerances for spherical roller bearings by shaft diameter and condition: for stationary inner ring loads use s4 when easy displacement is required and k6/m5/m6 when not, while general applications with normal to heavy loads (P > 0.07C ≤ 0.25C) use n6, p6, r6, or r7. Very heavy/shock loads (P > 0.25C) in rail and traction service use p6/r6/r7, with notes on tapered-bore/adapter-sleeve fits and RIC reduction, references to tolerance values for solid shafts, recommendations of g6 for wheels on non-rotating shafts and h6 for light/variable loads (P ≤ 0.07C), and the need for greater-than-normal internal clearance when the inner ring rotates or load direction is indeterminate.

#### Page 129

Housing fit guidelines for spherical roller bearings are provided for variable, rotating, indeterminate, and stationary outer ring loads, shock and heat conditions, and high-accuracy needs, with recommended tolerances (P6, P7, N7, M7, K7/J7, H7/H8, G7, K6/J6) and notes on axial displaceability. Under centrifugal-force loading, use a tight outer ring (P6) and a loose inner ring with Timken’s special s4 shaft fit (non-ISO), with s4 dimensional ranges listed for 50–250 mm bores, guidance to use W33 bearings with oil grooves/holes, and main-spindle fits M6/N6/P6 by O.D.

#### Page 130

Guidelines are provided for selecting shaft fits for cylindrical roller bearings (excluding 5200 series and four-row), organized by operating condition (inner ring stationary versus rotating/indeterminate), load limits relative to dynamic rating C (light 0–0.08C, normal 0.08–0.18C, heavy/shock 0.18C–C), shaft diameter ranges, and example applications such as wheels, tension pulleys, electrical apparatus/motors, machine tools, pumps, ventilators, industrial trucks, combustion engines, gear transmissions, rail vehicles, traction motors, and turbines. Recommended tolerances progress from g6 or h6 when the inner ring is stationary to j6/k6/m5–m6/n6/p6/r6/r7 as loads and diameters increase, with notes for high-precision options (j5, k5, m5), the requirement for greater-than-nominal internal clearance under heavy loads, and advice to consult Timken for pure thrust loads.

#### Page 131

Shaft fit guidelines for four-row cylindrical roller bearings on solid shafts recommend tolerance symbols by shaft diameter: n6 for 100–120 mm (3.93–4.72 in), p6 for 120–225 mm (4.72–8.85 in), r6 for 225–400 mm (8.85–15.75 in), and s6 for 400 mm (15.75 in) and above. Housing fit recommendations for cast iron/steel housings assign tolerance symbols by operating condition, including outer ring rotating (P6 for heavy loads/thin-walled housings; N6 for normal to heavy loads; M6 for light loads), indeterminate load direction (M7 for heavy shock loads; K6 when axial displacement is not required; J6 when axial displacement is desired), and outer ring stationary (J6 for shock loads/unloading; H6 for general one-piece housings; HT for radially split housings; G7 when heat is supplied through the shaft), with wider P7/N7/M7/K7/J7/H7 values permissible where allowed.

Bearing operating temperature limits are governed by lubricant capability at low temperatures and by material, lubricant, and accuracy constraints at high temperatures; standard bearing steels maintain ~58 HRC only to ~120°C (250°F), with Timken stabilization covering −54°C to 120°C for tapered roller/ball, up to 200°C for spherical roller, 150°C for cylindrical roller, and optional S0–S4 stability designations permitting max operating temperatures of 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350°C (302–662°F), though some dimensional change can still occur with time and temperature. Temperature influences lubricant film thickness (risking asperity contact at high heat), cold-start torque (primarily set by grease rheology), and cage/seal/shield performance, so designers must control thermal effects—e.g., limit precision spindle rise to 20–35°C while recognizing many systems operate hotter (gear drives ~93°C, gas turbines >100°C) and that prolonged high temperatures can alter shaft and housing fits and may necessitate special high‑temperature steels and oxidation-stable greases.

#### Page 187

An upper operating temperature limit of about 80-95°C (176-203°F) is more practical to reduce damage risk from transient spikes, with prototype testing advised and the equipment designer responsible for the final determination; Tables 111-112 give reference-only standard temperatures for common bearing materials, with other materials available on request from Timken. Table 112 details compositions, temperature capability bands, hardness and dimensional stability notes (<0.0001 in./in. over specified hours) for 52100 bearing steel (standard and FS136 heat-stabilized), ASTM A485 deep-hardening steels, carburizing steels (Ni-Mo grades like 4118/8620 and high-Ni 3310/3311), 440C stainless (FS238 heat-stabilized) and M-50, highlighting oxidation resistance, extra ductility uses for inner rings, the need to select 600°F-class materials for utmost stability, that 440C’s load capacity drops faster than M-50 at high temperatures, that thermal expansion is not included in stability data, and to consult Timken for >427°C (800°F) applications.

#### Page 188

Table 113 summarizes operating temperatures for bearing component materials, spanning roughly -54 C (-65 F) to 427 C (800 F) with reference points at 38 C/100 F, 93 C/200 F, 149 C/300 F, 204 C/400 F, 260 C/500 F, 316 C/600 F, and 371 C/700 F. It lists cage materials (molded 6/6 nylon, molded 6/6 fiberglass-reinforced nylon, phenolic resin laminate, low-carbon pressed steel, pressed stainless steel, machined bronze, machined iron-silicon bronze, machined steel), shield materials (low-carbon steel, stainless steel, nylon), and seal materials (Buna N, polyacrylic, fluoroelastomer, stabilized TFE fluorocarbon, TFE fluorocarbon with glass fabric), with a note that TFE fluorocarbon seals have limited life above these temperatures.

Bearing operating temperature is set by the balance of heat generated—mainly elastohydrodynamic losses at roller/ring contacts plus contributions from seals, gears, clutches, and oil supply—and heat dissipated via the housing and shaft, lubricant circulation, and the environment through conduction, convection, and radiation. Heat generation equals torque times speed (Qgen = k4 n M, with tapered bearing torque M = k1 G1 (np)^0.62 (Peq)^0.3), while heat removal by circulating oil is approximated by Qoil = k6 Cppf (To - Ti) or, for petroleum oils, Qoil = k5 f (To - Ti), with overall dissipation split between oil cooling and structural paths and splash systems optionally using cooling coils to control bulk oil temperature.

Rotational resistance of tapered roller bearings depends on load, speed, lubrication conditions, and internal characteristics, and the given formulas approximate running torque for oil-lubricated bearings, with grease or oil mist usually yielding lower torque after running-in stabilization. For a single-row design with external thrust Fae on bearing A, Table 114 presents two thrust conditions specifying net thrust loads (FaA and FaB), a running torque relation (e.g., M = k1 G1 (np)^0.62) and a minimum speed nmin with factors k1/k2, G1/G2, f1/f2/f3, and KA/KB; the torque equations are underestimated if n < nmin, and values for f1 and f2 are in fig. 144.

#### Page 191

The page presents torque equations for a double-row tapered roller bearing with external thrust on bearing A, outlining fixed-position cases where, if Fae > 0.47 FrAB, bearing B is unloaded, and if Fae ≤ 0.47 FrAB, load sharing defines FrA, FrB, M, and nmin for each row. It also covers the floating position (Bearing C) with its torque and minimum speed formulas, and defines constants k1 and k2, lubricant viscosity p, and combined load factors f2 and f3, while warning that torque results are underestimated when operating speed n is below nmin.

#### Page 192

A graph and rules (Fig. 144) define the combined load factors f3 and f2 for tapered roller bearings based on the ratio KFa/Fr. For KFa/Fr > 2.0, f3 = KFa/Fr and f2 = f3 + 0.8; for 0.47 ≤ KFa/Fr ≤ 2.0 values are read from the graph; and for KFa/Fr < 0.47, f3 = 0.06 and f2 = 1.78.

Fig. 145 shows dynamic viscosity values (mPa·s/cP) for ISO/ASTM industrial fluid lubricant grade designations plotted against temperature from about 30 to 120°C (80 to 240°F). The data assume a viscosity index of 90 and a specific gravity of 0.875 at 40°C (104°F), as presented in the Timken Engineering Manual (page 191).

#### Page 194

The torque M for cylindrical and spherical roller and ball bearings is given by M = f1 Fg dm plus a viscous term using f0 that is 10^-7 f0 (v·n)^(2/3) dm^3 when v·n ≥ 2000 or 160×10^-7 f0 dm^3 when v·n < 2000, with viscosity in centistokes. The load term Fg is defined by bearing type—e.g., for radial ball bearings FR = max(0.9 Fa cot α − 0.1 Fr, Fr) and for thrust ball/cylindrical/spherical roller bearings FR = Fa—and Table 116 provides f0 and f1 coefficients by bearing type and dimension series, including deep groove, angular contact, Gothic Arch, cylindrical/spherical roller, and thrust bearings.

Ball bearing maximum speed is not precisely fixed and depends on interrelated factors such as temperature, component accuracy, lubrication, tolerance grade, cage design, and (for duplex mounts) preload and contact angle; Timken guide values are found by multiplying pitch diameter (mm) by RPM for inner-ring rotation and, for outer-ring rotation, by additionally applying series factors of 1.3 (extra-small/extra-light), 1.5 (light), or 1.7 (medium), with ISO P0 suitable for normal speeds and ISO P5+ with ring-piloted composition cages and cooling oil-mist enabling exceptional speeds. While many applications can exceed the tabulated values (and others fall below them under adverse load, temperature, contamination, etc., with exclusions for special bearings such as radial Tri-Ply and square or hex bores), cylindrical and spherical roller bearing thermal speed ratings are based on balancing heat generation and dissipation assuming a radial load of 5% of static rating and lubrication as an oil bath to the middle of the lowest rolling element or a 30% grease cavity fill.

#### Page 196

Thermal speed ratings are based on standardized conditions: 12 cSt oil (ISO VG32) and 22 cSt grease base oil at 70°C, bearing and components at 70°C with a 20°C environment, steel or cast iron housing and shaft, a horizontal axis with a stationary outer ring and rotating inner ring, normal radial clearance with standard fits, no seals, and no misalignment or axial load; they are for reference only and require application-specific validation. Table 118 lists dm×N (mm×rpm) limits for single- and double-row radial ball bearing series and cage types under grease and oil (including circulating oil and oil mist) across ISO P0, P6, and P5/4, ranging roughly from 200,000–650,000 for standard designs to as high as 1,700,000 for extra-precision angular contact series, with guidance to maintain oil bath level 1/3–1/2 up from the bottom of the lowest ball, to limit sealed P/PP bearings to 300,000 PDN, and to consult for RR or Tri-Ply sealed bearings.

#### Page 197

For tapered roller bearings, speed is measured as the circumferential velocity at the midpoint of the inner ring large end rib and is calculated from the mean inner ring large rib diameter and rotational speed, with the mean rib diameter scaled from drawings or obtained from a Timken engineer and approximated as 99% of the larger rib O.D. Although DN (bore in mm × rpm) does not directly relate to rib speed due to cross-section variations, rough conversions are 1 m/s ≈ 16,000 DN and 1 ft/min ≈ 80 DN, and lubrication method strongly influences achievable speeds, ranging from routine operation to requiring testing and special bearings at higher speeds; consult your Timken engineer for high-speed capability.

A viscosity conversion table correlates Saybolt seconds (including SUS), Redwood seconds (R and R'), Engler degrees (E), and centistokes (cSt) across a wide range. It provides corresponding values from 35–100 sec (about 2.7–20.6 cSt) and from 450–10,000 SUS (about 97.4–2,200 cSt), with the associated Redwood and Engler readings listed at each step.

Comprehensive conversion tables between inches and millimeters are provided, including fractional inch values (from 1/16 to 15/16) across 0–15 inches and decimal conversions for tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and ten-thousandths. Millimeter-to-inch equivalents (10–300 mm) are listed, and standards (B.S.I. Norm No. 350, A.S.A. Norm No. B48.1, DIN 4890) affirm the exact relation 1 inch = 25.400 mm.

Table 126 presents approximate conversion values for steel hardness based on Rockwell C, correlating HRC with Brinell (10 mm ball, 3000 kg; standard, Hultgren, tungsten carbide), Vickers (diamond pyramid), Rockwell A/B/D, superficial 15-N/30-N/45-N, Shore Scleroscope, and approximate tensile strength (1000 psi). It spans high to lower HRC values (e.g., around 68 downward) and lists the associated test loads, penetrators, and ball diameters, with ASTM cited as the source.

Lubrication is required to maintain a bearing’s antifriction performance by separating mating surfaces to minimize rolling resistance and by reducing sliding friction among the rolling elements, raceways, and cage. It also transfers heat when using oil, protects against corrosion, and, with grease, helps prevent contaminant ingress.

#### Page 202

Lubricant selection depends on operating conditions, with oil generally preferred for high speeds and heat removal, while grease simplifies sealing, permits prelubrication, and typically requires less frequent relubrication. Oil lubrication uses high-quality mineral or synthetic oils and can be delivered via oil bath, circulating systems (providing cooling, metered supply, contaminant removal, filtration), or oil-mist for high-speed continuous operation, with success depending on proper entry port placement, controlled pressure drops, correct air/oil ratios, and EU sales of Timken-branded lubricants requiring REACH registration with ECHA.

#### Page 203

Before startup, oil-mist systems must run for several minutes to ensure bearing wetting, especially after extended idle, and adequate exhaust of the air-oil mist should follow. Lubricant selection hinges on oil type and viscosity: petroleum oils serve most bearing applications; synthetic oils (notably PAO) offer oxidation resistance and extreme-temperature performance, while silicone, ester and polyglycol types can have lower pressure-viscosity coefficients that reduce elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film thickness and bearing life; viscosity, which declines with temperature, is chosen based on load, speed, bearing setting and environment and is standardized by SAE, ASTM and ISO grades.

#### Page 204

An ISO/ASTM viscosity grade chart (ISO 3448) shows kinematic viscosity ranges at 40 C for industrial oils (e.g., ISO VG 22–680) assuming a viscosity index of 90, with corresponding Saybolt Universal Seconds per ASTM D2422. For typical roller bearing lubrication, it details general-purpose rust and oxidation inhibited oils and industrial EP gear oils—both solvent-refined, high-viscosity-index petroleum base with corrosion/oxidation inhibitors—specifying VI at least 80, pour point -10 C max, viscosity grades ISO VG 32–220 (R&O) or 100–460 (EP), EP additive per ASTM D2782 for the latter, plus requirements to avoid corrosive/abrasive materials, resist foaming, separate water, protect against boundary scoring, and to choose higher viscosity for high-temperature/slow-speed and lower viscosity for low-temperature/high-speed.

#### Page 205

Grease lubrication for low-to-moderate speeds uses a base oil, thickener, and additives, with mineral or synthetic oils and thickeners (lithium, aluminum, calcium soaps; inorganic gels, PTFE; polyurea) yielding specific traits—calcium/aluminum offer excellent water resistance, lithium is multi-purpose, synthetics provide wider ranges (about −73°C to 288°C), and polyurea shows outstanding bearing performance and is widely factory-filled. Performance in service hinges on rheology at low temperatures (starting torque), thermal/oxidation stability and thickener dropping point at high temperatures (synthetic bases can raise limits), and the rule of thumb that grease life halves for every 10°C (50°F) increase in temperature.

#### Page 206

In high-temperature, non-relubricatable applications (above 121°C/250°F), greases should use highly refined mineral or chemically stable synthetic base oils, be smooth and non-fibrous, resist thickening, separation, acid formation or hardening, have suitable consistency at operating temperature, and have a dropping point well above service temperature; a table presents the temperature ranges of base oils such as petroleum, ester, synthetic hydrocarbon, silicone, and perfluoroalkyl polyether. Contaminants like abrasive particles and water accelerate wear and reduce bearing fatigue life—initially causing high wear that diminishes as particles break down—with calcium and aluminum-complex greases offering water resistance, sodium-soap greases being unsuitable, and water-induced etching/corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement implicated in premature spalling, a trend echoed by water-based fluids.

#### Page 207

Timken application-specific greases, formulated with high-temperature, anti-wear and water-resistant additives, are matched in a selection guide to operating conditions and applications ranging from general industrial and construction/off-highway to pillow blocks, mills, food processing, synthetic industrial, and multi-use lithium options. Equipment builder specifications take precedence, and specialized needs (fretting corrosion, quiet running, chemical/solvent resistance, space/vacuum, food handling, electrical conductivity) may require custom lubricants, prompting consultation with a Timken engineer.

#### Page 208

Use the proper grease amount—typically one-third to one-half full—to avoid starvation or churning that cause heat, viscosity loss, leakage, lubricant breakdown and higher torque; allow space in the housing to expel excess while retaining grease with closures if needed, fully fill only for low-speed or during shutdown (remove excess before restart), and include a top grease fitting and vent plus a bottom drain for purging. For application and maintenance, pack grease between rolling elements (from large to small end for tapered rollers) by hand or with a mechanical packer and lightly coat exteriors, base relubrication intervals on operating temperature and sealing efficiency, add grease when levels drop and replace when degraded by contamination, heat, water or oxidation, consult suppliers or engineers if unsure, and note that Timken offers suitable lubricants and single- and multi-point lubricators.

#### Page 209

Prelubricated shielded and sealed bearings are used when grease could harm other components, space or cost precludes grease-filled housings, contamination is likely, or relubrication is impractical; they are packed with filtered, metered, chemically and mechanically stable greases, with polyurea and lithium-based greases preferred for general use and moisture resistance, and Timken ball bearings typically using polyurea/petroleum oil for radial and contact-seal wide inner ring (-34°C to +135°C) and synthetic thickener/synthetic hydrocarbon for labyrinth-seal wide inner ring (-54°C to +163°C). Grease consistency ranges from semi-fluid to solid, is measured by penetrometer penetration per NLGI grades, and softens with working, though laboratory “working” does not necessarily reflect the severe shearing in actual bearing service.

#### Page 210

A grease lubrication compatibility chart indicates Best Choice, Compatible, Borderline, and Incompatible combinations among grease types including aluminum/barium/calcium complexes and stearates, calcium sulfonate, clay non-soap, lithium stearate/12-hydroxy/complex, polyurea (conventional and shear stable), and Timken products such as Food Safe, Premium Mill, Heavy-Duty Moly, Multi-Use, All-Purpose, Synthetic, and Pillow Block. A note cautions that mixing greases can result in improper bearing lubrication and advises following the equipment supplier’s specific lubrication instructions.

#### Page 211

Seal selection for Timken bearings depends on lubricant type, environment, speed, and operating conditions; avoid spiral grooves on shafts (plunge grinding is suitable), provide venting between two bearings when using grease with contacting or non-contacting seals to prevent contamination from pressure differentials, and for vertical shafts typically use grease, oil-mist, or oil-air, with circulating oil for high-speed/heavy loads requiring excellent sealing and a suction pump to remove oil from the bottom bearing. For non-contacting seals, metal stampings suit clean environments and can be combined with other elements to form labyrinths in dirty conditions, while machined flingers with annular grooves allow closer clearances for better lubricant retention and contaminant exclusion; design clearances should be 0.5 to 0.6 mm on diameters between rotating and stationary parts with a minimum 3 mm axial gap, and umbrella-shaped flingers help retain oil and keep out dirt at high shaft speeds.

#### Page 212

Annular groove closures, often used with grease instead of radial lip seals in gritty, dusty environments, fill with grease that hardens to seal, interrupt oil capillary action with oils, and, especially when combined with a machined labyrinth, close-running clearances, and many grooves, provide highly effective protection, with suggested groove dimensions and diametral clearances given. Radial lip seals may be single, double, or triple and can use a spring-loaded lip, with the lip oriented inward for lubricant retention or outward for contaminant exclusion; in extremely dirty service they should be paired with flingers or shrouds and protected wear surfaces having about 0.25-0.40 um Ra finish and, under severe contamination, at least HRC 45 hardness, with supplier consultation for specifics.

#### Page 213

Contacting seal options include the DUO FACE-PLUS, whose double lips seal both the housing bore and the outer ring front face to eliminate machining a special surface and perform well with grease, and diaphragm seals with a spring-loaded metallic lip on the outer ring face plus an optional second lip to seal the housing. Mechanical face seals are used in extremely dirty, low-speed environments and typically run in an oil bath, with designs available for high-speed and special applications, while V-ring seals can be used with oil or grease and at higher speeds the lip lifts to act as a flinger, requiring supplier guidance for application limits.

#### Page 214

K and W single-row radial ball bearings can be supplied with one shield (suffix D) that permits relubrication from the open side or two shields (suffix DD) that are factory prelubricated for no-relubrication service. Non-filling slot Mechani-Seal bearings (suffixes L, LD, LL) feature a wider, offset inner ring for blind housings and a two-piece, non-contact labyrinth of dished steel members that retains grease and excludes contaminants at high speeds, with the wide W-LL version adding greater grease capacity and shaft/housing support to eliminate locknuts and lockwashers in applications like electric motors.

#### Page 215

Felt seals (T-type) comprise oil-saturated felt captured between outer-ring plates contacting the inner-ring OD for low-friction sealing; these non-filling slot bearings come with one seal (T), one seal plus one shield (TD), or two seals (TT), retain standard bores and ODs but are wider, and have inner rings offset opposite the seal for blind housing clearance. Rubber seal bearings (P-type) with one (P) or two (PP) molded synthetic rubber positive-contact seals are dimensionally interchangeable with open/shielded types (except extra-small sizes), while wide W-PP versions keep standard bores/OD but double-row widths to increase shaft/housing contact and grease capacity, simplifying compact electric motor designs.

#### Page 216

Timken’s R-type rubber seal bearings use a three-piece, positive-contact design with a synthetic rubber element protected by closely fitting steel shrouds and crimped into the outer ring, providing firm seal contact that prevents inward displacement while improving lubricant retention and resistance to contaminant ingress and abrasive damage, including in agricultural and textile applications. Tri-Ply Shroud Seal bearings feature a triple-lip nitrile seal molded to a heavy metal shroud cap with flared contact on the inner ring for exceptional protection in severe contamination or abrasion environments, and their balanced, extra-wide inner-ring design simplifies housings, enhances shaft support, and is widely used on conveyors and farm machinery such as disc harrows, hillers, tomato harvesters, and cotton harvesters.
