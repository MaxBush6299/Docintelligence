{"documentId": "github-copilot-exam-prep", "status": "success", "summary": "The guide recommends two complementary preparation paths that cater to different learning preferences. Microsoft Learn provides structured, module-based curricula that span the development lifecycle, with paths focused on GitHub Copilot Fundamentals and on accelerating app development using Copilot. These cover concepts, hands-on exercises, and practical guidance. For learners who prefer a video-first approach, a LinkedIn Learning path titled “Prepare for the GitHub Copilot Certification” is planned to help you apply features and understand how they are assessed; it will be available soon. Together, these offerings deliver complete learning journeys tailored to both self-paced, interactive modules and instructor-led video instruction.\n\nBeyond study resources, the guide details the capabilities and practices you’re expected to master for the exam. Copilot can generate unit, integration, and other types of tests; suggest coverage for edge cases; improve existing tests; write assertions; and produce boilerplate to streamline setup. It supports code quality, security, and performance efforts, and learns from existing tests to refine its recommendations. At the organizational level, Copilot Enterprise enables collaborative reviews and helps teams adopt best practices, including identifying security vulnerabilities and performance optimizations during code review. The guide also underscores privacy and administration fundamentals: understanding product SKUs, configuring organizational options appropriately, and using the Copilot Editor configuration file to manage behavior and privacy controls."}
